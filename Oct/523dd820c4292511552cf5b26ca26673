The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Monday detained the wife of former Minister of Aviation, Mrs. Precious Fani-Kayode in Ado Ekiti. Precious, who was a guest of Governor Ayodele Fayose, had gone to an Access Bank branch in Ado Ekiti around 3p.m. for transactions when she was detained by officials of the bank. Sensing that she was not being promptly attended, she inquired from officials what the problem was and was told she was being detained on the instruction of the EFCC.
