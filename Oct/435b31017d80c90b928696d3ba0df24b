Magnus Eze, Enugu The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Enugu State has said every gang-up against the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, will collapse as pack of cards.  State Chairman of the party, Dr. Ben Nwoye, told newsmen, yesterday, in Enugu, that the protests against the Oshiomhole-leadership by some aggrieved members of the party were uncalled.  Some members of the party, including the Director-General of Voice of Nigeria (VON),  Osita Okechukwu, who were disenchanted over the outcome of the party’s primary elections, had accused Oshiomhole of perpetuating impunity.  Nwoye, urged the aggrieved members to sheathe their swords in the overall interest of the party.

Some got angry, left and joined a party that is unknown in Enugu State. I’m still begging them to come back because APGA is a ship bound for wreck.  “Those who stayed behind, my good friend, Osita Okechukwu, for instance, who is a major stakeholder and pillar of the party, while we believe he should have won, he didn’t win. But, he has taken on Oshiomhole, who is God sent, he has won elections, this is a man that Enugu State endorsed, including Osita, that endorsement still stands.”
