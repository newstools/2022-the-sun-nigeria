In keeping with his administration’s Urban Renewal drive, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State, yesterday, inspected Trans Ekulu Bridge, Enugu, with a view to beautifying the area as one of the gateways to the city. Ugwuanyi also inspected vehicular traffic at the bridge and the connecting roads  to proffer solution to the gridlock being experienced by road users in the axis basically caused by increase in population strength of the state. The governor further inspected the New Market axis of Enugu, which is another gateway to the city, ahead of his administration’s plans to reconstruct and modernise the roundabout and maintain the roads to give the area a face-lift. From the New Market, the governor moved to inspect the ongoing construction of Justice Nwazota-Ilogu Close Road, GRA, Enugu, with a spur to Works Road Layout. Ugwuanyi thereafter inspected Leadway Insurance Street, GRA, Enugu and other bypasses, for necessary interventions, aimed at decongesting traffic in the city. Already, the newly constructed T-junction Flyover Bridge by Nike Lake Road, Enugu East Local Government Area, and the reconstructed and modernised Milliken Hill Road, Ngwo, Enugu North council, have provided the needed face-lift and traffic decongestion in the two gateways to Enugu.
