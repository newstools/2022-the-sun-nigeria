Villarreal is interested in Super Eagles forward, Sadiq Umar but must first sell a player to accommodate the Almeria attacker. Strong interests have come from the Ceramica but Umar is valued at €20m by Almeria and Villarreal does not have such money budgeted for any player. With growing interests coming from West Ham for Nigerian-born Dutch international, Arnaut Danjuma, Villarreal hopes to receive at least €36m and trigger a move for Umar. The Andalusian outfit, Almeria might play hardball over the forward as he is considered significant to their push for safety in the La Liga this season. Holding suitors off may however come difficult as Sevilla and Benfica have indicated interest also. Other than Villarreal, reports from Italy say Ajax is also interested in the former Partizan Belgrade forward, especially after the exit of Sebastian Haller to Borussia Dortmund. Spanish daily, Relevo reported that Almeria will hold out for €20m as 20% of any potential transfer fee is going to Partizan Belgrade.
