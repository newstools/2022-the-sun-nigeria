From Lateef Dada,  Osogbo All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned call by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for visa and diplomatic ban of its member over allegations of rigging. APC, in a statement by spokesperson to the Chairman, Gboyega Famodun, Kola Olabisi, described the allegation as baseless and unfounded. He said the governorship candidate of the APC who is seeking re-election, Adegboyega Oyetola, has been campaigning round the clock by carrying his message to the nooks and crannies of the state. “It’s time the Osun PDP got serious, at least, for once, and face the July 16, 2022 governorship election where they will meet perfidy through imminent monumental failure. “It is the phobia for the imminent failure of the PDP in the governorship poll that is staring them in the face that has been responsible for the cooked-up allegation,” Olabisi said. Meanwhile, former running mate of Ademola Adeleke, governorship candidate of PDP, Albert Adeogun, has led hundreds of his supporters to the APC. The former member of the House of Representatives was received by Governor Oyetola into the fold of APC alongside the factional chairman of the PDP, Wale Ojo, and an aspirant to the House of Representatives in Ede federal constituency, Ayodele Asalu. A chieftain of the PDP, Soji Ibikunle, also led his supporters to the Freedom Park, Osogbo, to join the APC. National Secretary of the APC, Iyiola Omisore, welcomed the defectors for ‘taking the right decision to join the development train’ of the progressive government in the state.
