Reacting to the performance of the market, analysts at Cordros Capital, said they expect alpha-seeking investors to continue to seek trading opportunities in companies that delivered impressive earnings during the first quarter (Q1) of 2022 earnings season despite the expectation of an uptick in yields in the FI market. “However, we think the absence of a near-term catalyst will likely skew overall market sentiments to the negative side, particularly as the political space gets heated up. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings”, they said. For their part, analysts at Coronation Research, said, “the market might experience jitters in the early trading session. However, we believe the market would rebound and close the week positively as investors position for interim dividend”.
