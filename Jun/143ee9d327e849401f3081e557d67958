One of the agents who worked on Victor Osimhen’s record breaking move from Lille to Napoli has dragged the Super Eagles to Ikeja court on account of his alleged refusal to pay him his commission from the deal, reports owngoalnigeria.com. Osita Okolo, who is said to be an in-law to the striker, claimed to be part of the team behind Osimhen’s move to Napoli for a fee of around €71.2m, but that amount is currently being disputed by an investigation into the deal by the Italian and French authorities. According to the report, William D’Avilla, who was part of the main act in brokering the deal, was due a commission of €5m from which he will pay Osita €1.3m. D’Avilla paid Osita $450 and another €91. According to the report, Osimhen allegedly collected $439 and €89 paid to Osita, saying he wanted to use it to settle other family members with a promise to pay his in-law when he’s settled in Italy. The report said Osimhen didn’t return the cash as promised and in November, Osita went public in an interview. This, it was gathered, didn’t go down well with Osimhen, who allegedly texted him to say he won’t have him as his agent anymore. On January 4, Osimhen was said to have paid Osita €20,000, leaving a balance of $439 and €69,000. The dispute has landed the duo in contact with Osita insisting on getting his money in full. All attempts by owngoalnigeria.com to reach Osimhen, according to the portal, have proved abortive while Osita has refused to elaborate on the matter but admitted he’s in court over an issue with Osimhen. “I can’t confirm anything to you on my issue with Osimhen but we are in court over an issue that has dragged on for a while. That’s all I can tell you,” he told owngoalnigeria.com. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video This is a modal window.
