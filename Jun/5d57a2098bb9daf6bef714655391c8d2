Governor Rotimi Akeredolu said the “vile and satanic attack” was a calculated assault on the peace-loving people of Owo Kingdom who have enjoyed relative peace over the years. “It is a black Sunday in Owo. Our hearts are heavy. Our peace and tranquility have been attacked by the enemies of the people. This is a personal loss, an attack on our dear state,” the governor who had to cut short his party’s national assignment in Abuja to visit Owo immediately said. “This is an unexpected development. I am shocked to say the least. Nevertheless, we shall commit every available resource to hunt down these assailants and make them pay. We shall never bow to the machinations of heartless elements in our resolves to rid our state of criminals,” he said.
