Abutu said the abductee was released at Obbo Ayegunle, a border town in Kwara State. “He was freed at Obbo Ayegunle in Kwara State. Our men and the local hunters as well as Amotekun operatives were inside the bush searching for him for over 27 hours before he was located. “Our people would have to be security conscious.
