From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure The leadership of the Action Alliance (AA) has dispelled the alleged litigation instituted against the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, declaring that the party has nothing against Tinubu. The National Chairman of the party, Hon Adekunle Rufai Omoaje, in a statement issued on Thursday, said that the APC presidential standard-bearer has not committed any offence that will warrant a court case against him by the party He said “it has come to the notice of the leadership of Action Alliance that a suit was purportedly filed on behalf of the party at the Federal High Court, Abuja against the All Progressive Congress and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. “The matter said to be filed and deposed to by one Upkai Ukairo and one Kalu Agu has nothing to do with Action Alliance. As a matter of fact, both Upkai Ukairo and Kalu Agu are alien to the party and its leadership. They most probably are effigies or at best imaginary personalities,” he added. Omoaje maintained that the party did not file any suit against Tinubu, just as he said that no member of the party could institute a case on behalf of the party without his knowledge. “We advise the said respondents in the purported suit to disregard and discountenance the entire matter in its entirety as it did not emanate from my table as the National Chairman of the party neither was our legal desk in the know of such matter,” he stressed. The AA National Chairman warned the populace to be wary of persons with questionable character with the intention to take advantage of them. He said the leadership of the party is busy working to fulfil all legal documentation required by law to participate in the approaching Osun State gubernatorial election and the 2023 general elections.
