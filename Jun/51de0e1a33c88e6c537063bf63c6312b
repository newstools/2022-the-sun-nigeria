From Judex Okoro, Calabar  The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has promised to reposition Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to enable the operators access available funding opportunities and accelerate economic growth.  The Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of NEPC, Ezra Yakusak, who disclosed this at a one- day capacity training workshop, held at Adsuit Hotel in  Calabar, described MSMEs as key economic drivers vital in realising the core mandate of the agency which entails economic diversification  through promotion of non oil exports. The NEPC boss, who was represented by the Chief Trade Promotion Officer, Calabar Area Office, Mrs Slyvia Adeneye, said the capacity building workshop programme is aimed at equipping operators of small enterprises in Cross River on how to develop attractive  business proposals. He said: “The agency is commited to ensuring  that MSMEs  access available funding opportunities in order to accelerate economic growth. Therefore, the skill training on how to write scripts would enhance their business and attract investors and financiers. He decried the credit supply gap between financial institutions and MSMEs, noting that such scenario often frustrates efforts by the MSMEs in fulfilling their traditional role as viable mechanism for driving indigenous industries, creating employment opportunities,  boosting the development of local technology as obtainable in other countries.
