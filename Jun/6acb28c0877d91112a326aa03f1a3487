The London Stock Exchange (LSE) yesterday, celebrated outgoing and pioneer chairman of Seplat Energy Plc, Dr ABC Orjiako for his many achievements while on the board of Nigeria’s leading energy company.  Seplat Energy which is listed on both Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) and London Stock Exchange is driving the country’s energy transition towards cleaner, more reliable energy as Orjiako retires after 13 years as board chairman. Orjiako in his reaction at the event in London, said: “It is the magnanimity of the LSE (London stock exchange) and LSEG’s Africa Advisory Group (LAAG) that made it possible for us to be here today. It is not an easy thing to ring the opening bell of the LSE, for me to use this to mark my exit as the chairman of Seplat brings very old memories to me starting from 2014 when we first rang the bell to list our security on this market.” “One of the things that gladdens my heart is the fact that everything on the board turned green as we rang the bell; this is very important for us in Seplat. Colour green not only signifies good performance in the market, but because green is a very important symbol in Seplat.  It symbolises life, it symbolises what this company represents particularly sustainability and business,” Orjiako said. Orjiako further said: “I want to thank you for this great opportunity.  I am the last of the founders of Seplat to leave. For Seplat, it is a promise kept. It is a very strong and apt statement to say that Seplat believes in enduring strong and robust corporate governance practices. We made up our minds from the beginning that this company will fly and grow if we maintain very good corporate governance. So, when we started, we made a promise that the chairmanship of this company would be handed to an independent non-executive chairman”.
