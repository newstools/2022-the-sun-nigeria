Victor Osimhen has vowed to score more goals for the Super Eagles following his goalscoring heroics in Nigeria’s biggest ever win on Monday. The Arsenal target proved his worth, scoring four goals for the Eagles, who thrashed Sao Tome and Principe 10-0 in their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations Group A qualifier in Agadir, Morocco. Osimhen emerged as a leading transfer target for Mikel Arteta’s side and he showed off his attacking prowess for his national side taking his tally to 15 goals in 22 games for the three-time African champions. According to reports, Osimhen’s agent flew to London for talks with Arsenal about a potential transfer last week. However, the north London club understands Napoli will only consider offers considerably above the £65m that they played for the 23-year-old two years ago. Speaking after his side’s win, the 23-year-old said he wouldn’t relent on his efforts scoring for the team. Osimhen said;  “First of all, I have to say congratulations to the entire team and also a big kudos to the coach for all the instructions he gave us.  “I believe we carried out 80 to 90 per cent of them and of course I am happy to score four goals and I am happy for my teammates that got their goals as well..  “There is a big solidarity in the team and this is what the coach has taught us. I believe as a group we have the quality to build on this momentum. And yes, I want to score more goals for the team, and of course keep on getting the wins for the team.
