The agreement for the on-lending of this additional grant by the bank to ECOWAS is currently being finalised.  “Thus, in addition to its substantial contribution of US$ 25 million, the bank will have mobilised  €12.63 million in the form of a grant from the European Union, bringing the total amount available for the financing of this highly strategic study to the equivalent of about US$ 41 million.”she said Minister of Works and Housing and Chairman of the partnering states said the completion earlier slated for 2021, was delayed due to the impact of 2020 COVID-19  pandemic that stalled global activities. He said while it was expedient for the job to be done quickly, it was critical to ensure that nothing should be sacrificed for quality of the job that would serve over 40 million Africans in each of these countries.
