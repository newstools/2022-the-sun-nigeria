From Noah Ebije, Kaduna Terrorists, in the late hours of Tuesday, invaded Sabon Gero, a community in millinium city, and killed a civilian Joint Task Force (JTF) Commander and a resident of the area. Other 16 residents, including a medical doctor and his family members, were also said to have been abducted in the area. The terrorists, it was gathered, stormed the community on motorcycles at about 10pm, on Tuesday, and started shooting sporadically. It was gathered that the JTF commander and other members, immediately opened fire at the rampaging terrorists, not knowing that they were very close to them. “The terrorists opened fire and hit the commander on his legs and he fell down, and they shot him on the head, scattering his skull. A resident who was, also, hit by a bullet died on the way to the hospital. A source, who pleaded anonymity, said two people lost their lives, 16 abducted, while six were rescued during the attack. He said the bandits might have targeted the house of a medical doctor in the area, as they went straight to his residence and abducted him and six members of his family. “They stormed other houses and abducted nine other people,” he added. A member of the JTF, who gave his name as Isa Usman, confirmed that their commander had been killed by the terrorists. We took his body to his wife and later buried him,” he said.
