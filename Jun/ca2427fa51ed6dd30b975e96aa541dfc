The APC chieftain said that they will mobilize votes via vigorous campaigning across the federal constituency to ensure that he wins the main election next year. “The emergence of Akarachi Amadi as the candidate for Ikeduru/Mbaitoli Federal constituency in the 2023 National Assembly polls will change the narratives of the poor quality of representation being suffered by the people of Ikeduru/Mbaitoli in recent times. We are going to make sure that he wins the main election next year by vigorously campaigning for him across the entire federal constituency,” he said.
