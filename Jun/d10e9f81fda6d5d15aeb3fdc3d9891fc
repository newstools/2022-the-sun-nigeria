Senegal football star, Sadio Mane says the failure of Nigeria to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is a blow to the African continent. Nigeria lost out on qualifying for the World Cup after losing on away goal, rule to Ghana. It’s the second time since 1994 that Nigeria won’t be at the World Cup after failing to qualify for the 2006 edition in Germany. Mane and his Senegalese teammates edged out Egypt to pick of the five available slots fro Africa at the World Cup holding in November. He feels Africa will be without some of its traditional powerhouse and star players. “You get people asking why is Salah not going to be at the World Cup. Egypt has a very strong team; we were lucky to deny them qualification. What about Cote d’Ivoire? Nigeria with their arrays of star players and entertaining brand of football won’t be at the World Cup. That’s a blow to the continent,” he told FIFA Productions in a broadcast.
