Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, has stated that Africa is ready to engage on equal terms with the rest of the world in the area of maritime businesses. He made this known at the Nor-Shipping 2017, Lillstrome, Norway, stating that it is high time Africa stopped others “from engaging us on their own terms, whether they bring vessels to us or just taking our cargoes; rather all we want is a mutually beneficial relationship where we can give and also receive. “What we are trying to do is to change the terms of engagement for the rest of the world in terms of maritime businesses. “We want to operate on equal terms not lopsided terms against our own interest, thereby creating room for a mutually beneficial relationship.” He added that Nigeria’s participation at Nor-Shipping “is to say to the world that we have a lot to offer. “There are lots of opportunities in the maritime administration of Nigeria; we are diversifying our economy, we are the biggest economy in Africa with a vast population, vast coastline of over 800 kilometers, endowed with many natural resources and a good Gross Domestic Product (GDP) amongst others. So if you have to do business in Africa, you must talk about Nigeria.”
