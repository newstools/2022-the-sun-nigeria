From Gabriel Dike  The National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE)  said it has uncovered over 200 illegal institutions running National Certificate of Education (NCE) programmes nationwide. Executive Secretary of NCCE, Prof. Paulinus Okwelle, disclosed this in Lagos at a capacity building workshop for provosts and senior academic staff organised by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund). He said the commission would soon review the curriculum of colleges of education in 2022. “We are addressing the issue of illegal colleges of education in the country. NCCE has identified 200 illegal institutions including some universities running NCE programmes without approval. We have sent the report to the Minister of Education.  NCCE is waiting for ministerial directive on the illegal institutions. Some of them have been informed and asked to regularise their status. As soon as we are through, we will start the process of closing them down,” Okwelle said. On curriculum review, he said the commission rather than wait for every five years would be carrying out the exercise on a regular basis. Okwelle said the commission carried out the curriculum review in 2020 and it was rolled out for implementation in 2021. “We want to carry out holistic review of curriculum for colleges of education. We will soon commence another exercise. Because of the current trend, we may carry it out on a regular basis.” Executive Secretary, Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), Sonny Echono, said the capacity building workshop was meant to equip and reposition  provosts of Colleges of Education to face their tasks effectively.
