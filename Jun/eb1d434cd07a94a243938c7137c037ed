Management of Mudiame University, Irrua, Edo State, has described Monday Okpebholo as a rare breed among the political class, saying he is a promise keeper. The university management team stated this when the APC senatorial candidate for Edo Central delivered a set of computers as part of his contributions to the development of the institution. During the handover ceremony, Registrar of the university, Johnson Akorede, described Okpebholo also known as Akpakomiza as a promise keeper who is not like other politicians. Okpebholo had few weeks ago during the university’s maiden matriculation ceremony, pledged to donate brand new computers as part of his contribution to the university for its take off. Okpebholo, who is also an industry player in ICT, promised to donate data to the university for the next one year. Akorede while receiving the computers, said: “On behalf of the Chancellor, S. E. Eromosele, and the Vice Chancellor, Ernest Izevbigie, I want to profoundly thank Okpebholo for the prompt fulfilment of the promise he made penultimate week ago. Indeed, Akpakomiza is a ‘promise keeper’.” Other members of the university, while expressing delight over the prompt fulfilment of his promise, noted that Akpakomiza was, indeed, a different breed of politician. “He is not the regular politicians that make so much noise and promises which they will never fulfil. His action is a clear demonstration that he can be trusted with public office,” he said. Mudiame University in Irrua, Esan Central LGA, few weeks ago matriculated its maiden students at a well-attended ceremony.
