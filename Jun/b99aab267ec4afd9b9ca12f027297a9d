From Okwe Obi, Abuja A report released by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), revealed that 2.3 million Nigerians in 452,363 in North East were displaced in 2021. NEMA noted that the displacement was caused by Boko Haram insurgents, farmers/herdsmen clashes, COVID-19, natural disaster such as flooding, building collapse, and fire incidents. Presenting the report to the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development Sadiya Umar Farouq, yesterday in Abuja, NEMA Director General, Mustapha Habib Ahmed, noted that the report was carried out in partnership with International Organization for Migration (IOM). “The report of round 39 Displacement Tracking Matrix carried out in the North-East by NEMA and International Organization for Migration (IOM) as at 30th December, 2021 put the number of IDPs at 2,200,357 amounting to 452,363 displaced households (HHs). “The call by stakeholders for paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management from a relief-centered to all inclusive and integrated approach covering the entire gamut of disaster management (prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, relief, reconstruction and rehabilitation) necessitated the mainstreaming of disaster risk management in Nigeria,” Ahmed said. He, however, stated that activities ofState Management Agencies (SEMAs) and Local Emergency Management Committees (LEMCs), were hampered due to the lack of well-equipped personnel and tools. He said: “It is important to note that the absence of well-equipped functional State Management Agencies (SEMAs) and Local Emergency Management Committees (LEMCs), in some States and LGAs respectively have continued to hinder the efforts of NEMA to achieve its target of Emergency Risk Prevention, Mitigation, Preparedness and Response in the country.” On her part, the Minister, who was represented by Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Dr Nasir Sani Gwarzo commended NEMA for timely submission of the document and assured of her continuous supports to the Agency.
