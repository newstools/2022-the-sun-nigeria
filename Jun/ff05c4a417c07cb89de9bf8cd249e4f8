Meanwhile the victim and the suspect has been taken to hospital for medical attention. “The Commissioner of Police, CP Echeng Echeng, has reiterated the campaign against mob action by some members of the public who resort to jungle justice whenever they arrest suspects in respect of any crime. “They should endeavour to take such suspect to the nearest police station whenever they are apprehended. “This would afford the police the opportunity to conduct an appropriate investigation into the nefarious activities of the suspects, and bring them to justice in accordance with extant laws. Further details shall be communicated please”, the statement reads.
