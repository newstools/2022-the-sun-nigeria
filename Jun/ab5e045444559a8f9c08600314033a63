The reigning African and CommonWealth Games champion, Tobi Amusan, has dedicated her recent feats to her mother. Amusan once again set another record at the National Athletes Trails in Benin, Edo State when she ran a 12.54s to set a new Championship record and retain the title as well. The 25 year-old said; “Setting a new record is special to me though but execution matters. Everytime I complete, I wasn’t always worried about running fast to beat the time, I just want to get a clean race and get the win. When I broke the African record, I was kind of shocked. The fast rising sprinter didn’t hide her admiration of having her mother watch her when she runs as she dedicated her win to her. “I dedicate my victory to my mom. She has been very supportive to me and watching me run gives me motivation,” she concluded.
