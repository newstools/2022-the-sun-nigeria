By Lawrence Enyoghasu, Lagos The Nigeria Youth Corporate Social Responsibility Fund (NYCSRF) has warned the federal and Lagos governments over kingship imposition in Oworoshoki, Lagos State community, and has given an ultimatum to reverse the decision to avoid erupting violence in the community. The warning was issued by the Director-General of the group, Hon Vincent Anthony Ubani, at a press conference held in the community, adding that the intervention of the group is to avoid a repeat of ENDSARS in the state. According to Ubani, the act of not considering or unjustly denying youths’ choice in the ancestral kingship positions in the state is rampant and needs to be addressed. “Nurudeen Olalekan Saliu was the Oba-elect by the people but the state government imposed a different person instead, denying the people their right to choose their leader,” he stated. “The office of the Lagos State Director of NYCSRF, Amb Akindayomi Olasunkanmi, reported to the NYCSRF and President National Youth Council of Nigeria NYCN, Amb Solomon Adodo, about the tension the youths constituency in the Oworoshoki Kingdom over the matter of imposition. The agitation is currently growing which needs to be settled before it turns to violence. “It is on this note that NYCSRF has penned down our request and appeal that all authorities are to, as a matter of urgency, look into the matter and see how Lagos state government can urgently address the tension by approving the original Oba Elect of Oworoshoki Kingdom, Oba Nurudeen Olalekan Saliu. The documents presented have shown that Saliu is the rightful Oba and that the government was supposed to be approved with the legal documents as a backup as well. “We look forward to the authorities’ earliest reaction and formidable approach to restore peace to the Oworoshoki Kingdom as the decision was taken weeks ago has left many in shock and hospitalized because the state government approval of the wrong person as the Oba of the Oworoshoki Kingdom which the Oworo people see such act as a betrayer to the good people of Oworoshoki Kingdom,” he stated.
