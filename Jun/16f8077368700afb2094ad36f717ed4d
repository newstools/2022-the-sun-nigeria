From Fred Itua, Abuja President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, yesterday, said the Federal Government, through the Nigerian High Commission in London, has stepped into the ongoing saga involving former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, over his alleged involvement in organ harvesting of a minor in the UK. Prior to Lawan’s revelation, the Senate held a close door session, where the issue was extensively discussed by lawmakers. Lawan also revealed that some senators were detailed to travel to London, United Kingdom on Friday, to explore diplomatic options in resolving the issue. He said the  Nigerian High Commissioner to United Kingdom, Sarafadeen Ishola, briefed senators at a closed door session on the matter. “We had a close door session with the Nigerian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. He briefed us on efforts they have taken to address the plight of Ekweremadu and his wife. The Senate will not abandon Ekweremadu. We will stand by him. The High Commissioner told us that they’ve hired some lawyers to represent Ekweremadu when he appears in court. They’re also providing other consular services Ekweremadu. “We’ve delegated some of our members to visit the United Kingdom on a fact-finding mission. They’ll come back here and report to us on their findings. “I call on the Nigerian Government, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to use all diplomatic avenues to address the issue and assist Ekweremadu. At the point, there’s not much we can do. But we will stand by him,” said Lawan.
