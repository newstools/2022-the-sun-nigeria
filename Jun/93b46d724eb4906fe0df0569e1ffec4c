In the report of the committee obtained by our correspondent, the petitioner complained about the replacement of authentic delegates with impostors, and the committee agreed that he had proved allegation of the manipulation of the delegate list. The committee noted that the petitioner presented the evidence of the authentic list of Ad-hoc delegates as elected to vote in the primaries and the manipulated list of delegates, used for the election. “The petitioner was able to identify the authentic delegates who were removed from the authentic list. He went further to present the names of the said supposedly fake delegates that voted. “He also presented copies of his petition which he submitted to the state party office and the police before and after the election.
