Union Berlin is putting the finishing touches to a deal for the United States of America forward, Theoson-Jordan ‘Pefok’ Siebatcheu, days after sanctioning the departure of Super Eagles star, Taiwo Awoniyi. Brought in from Liverpool as the Berliner’s most expensive signing at €8.5 million, Awoniyi scored 15 goals in the Bundesliga last term – the most in history by any Union Berlin player. The 24-year-old was duly rewarded with a dream move to the Premier League a few days ago, with Nottingham Forest paying a club-record €20.5 million to get their primary target. That transfer fee is the most that Union Berlin has ever received for a player, and the Iron Ones are close to releasing less than a third of it to secure the departed striker’s replacement. And according to Sport 1, as per 90 min, Union Berlin will cough out €6 million to acquire the services of Jordan Pefok from Swiss Super League club Young Boys. The 26-year-old scored 22 goals to top the goalscoring chart in the Swiss elite division last season, and he also scored twice in six games in the Champions League group stage. A former youth international for France, Pefok previously played for Reims and Rennes in the French league. The American will, however, have big shoes to fill, with Awoniyi smashing 20 goals in all competitions for the Iron Ones last season alone.
