The awards mostly through research and recommendation will honour both individuals and bodies. “Our vision is to be a platform that promotes, rewards and celebrates human excellence in the care of mankind for its kind. Our mission is to continually search and honour individuals and bodies that care for all citizens of mankind, especially children, youths in target community or sector.” In a similar vein, convener, Regina Robinson noted: “We are seeking a partnership that will ring this noble project. We want to help create a better world full of understanding for the need to show that caring for others is caring for one’s self.”
