From Noah Ebije, Kaduna Chairman, Board of Trustees (BOT) of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Walid Jibrin, has tackled the former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, over recent comments that he made a mistake choosing Atiku Abubakar as vice president in 1999. Senator Jibrin, second republic lawmaker, said if the former president failed to clarify the statements within 48 hours, the party would be left with no option than to expose him (Obasanjo) and tell Nigerians his true colour when he ruled the country for eight years. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna, Jibrin said he and the PDP have high regards and respect for the former president, but added that it would be disappointing if the statement credited to him and carried in virtually all the national dailies is true. He pointed out that if not for Atiku that kicked against third term agenda under Obasanjo government between 1999 and 2007, the country would have suffered unimaginable crisis. “There is no doubt Obasanjo may still be angry with Atiku even after helping him to succeed but perhaps for truncating his third term agenda. In any case, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku is our presidential candidate and I can tell you for sure that he will be the president in 2023 insha Allah”. On the the choice of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate, the BoT chairman disclosed that a high powered reconciliatory committee is soon to be constituted to meet Governor Wike and appeal to him.
