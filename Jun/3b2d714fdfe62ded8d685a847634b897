Leicester City has had more than their fair share of injury worries over the last couple of seasons, with the club hoping that changes for 2022/23. At one point last season, City was down to just eight outfield players available as the injury nightmare took hold. Thankfully, the situation eased as the season went on as long-term absentees such as James Justin, Wesley Fofana and Ricardo Pereira returned. By the final game of the season, City had just two players in Wilfred Ndidi and Ryan Bertrand missing through injury as more and more players returned to action. After a summer break, Brendan Rodgers is now welcoming players back for pre-season. Ahead of the start of the new season, the injury picture is already looking a lot better for City with the club providing an update on influential midfielder Ndidi. According to a statement from the club, the Nigerian could return fully on August 7. It is hoped that the injury situation will be a lot kinder to the club this time around. The defensive midfielder missed the final 16 games of the season in all competitions after undergoing surgery on his medial ligament in his knee. He has been working on his recovery over the summer and now has returned to take part in pre-season. Leicester City has now shared an update showing the midfielder taking part in pre-season with the rest of his teammates. The video shows Ndidi taking part in drills outside on the pitches along with a message reading: “Back with the squad… Looking good out there, @Ndidi25”
