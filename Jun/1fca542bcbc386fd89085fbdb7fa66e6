By Zika Bobby A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, (APC), in Delta State, Chief Gabriel Oyibode, said the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) poses no threat to his party in the forthcoming general elections. Oyibode said  the APC will take Delta by storm, stressing that the people of the oil-rich state were tired of bad governance occasioned by poverty and despondency. He said the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege-led APC in the state will attract what he described as immeasurable victory because he has done what others before him failed to do in terms of massive grassroots development. He maintained that the DSP having assembled what he called a team of political arsenals led by Chief Omeni Sobotie, to chase the PDP out of power, the masses of the oil-rich state are very much ready and wiling to enthrone progressives government to succeed Governor Ifeanyi Okowa,  adding that there’s no doubt in his mind that Omo-Agege is the choice of the people. He noted that the quality and purposeful Senatorial representation in service delivery exuded by the lawmakers representing Delta Central coupled with the superlative  performance of Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, representing Delta North were the selling points of the APC towards 2023 to wrest power from the PDP in the state.
