A combined team of police and military operatives foiled a mission by bandits on the Kaduna-Abuja Highway, yesterday. The team killed one of the bandits, recovered one AK47 rifle and nine of their operational motorcycles. Police spokesman in Kaduna State, DSP Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the incident in a statement issued in Kaduna. He stated that the feat was another indication of successful and purposeful synergy between the police and the military in Kaduna State. “On Monday, June 13, at 2:55am, a team of Police Operation Puff Adder and that of the army’s Operation Thunder Strike on routine patrol along the Kaduna-Abuja highway encountered the bandits at Sabon Sara. “An exchange of gunfire ensued as a result of which the friendly forces truncated the bandits’ mission, forcing them to retreat into the forest as one bandit was neutralised. “Upon a search of the general area, an AK47 rifle and nine bandits’ operational motorcycles were recovered,’’ he stated. The police urged residents in the area to report people with suspected gunshot wounds to security agencies as “injured criminal elements will be hibernating around nearby communities to access healthcare services.”
