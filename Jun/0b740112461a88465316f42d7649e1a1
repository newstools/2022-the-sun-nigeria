From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The National President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Dr Samson Ayokunle, has warned All Progressives Congress (APC), to resist the temptation to go for a Muslim-Muslim ticket in next year’s election, insisting that it won’t fly. This is as he warned that such a step would be disastrous for the nation. Recall that Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, had said there was nothing wrong about the controversial Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket. There is report making the rounds that the APC and its candidate, Bola Tinubu, might settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket, given the party’s difficulty in finding a Christian from the North, who would be acceptable enough to boost the party’s chances in the election. The CAN President who was represented by the President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria and Founder of Sword of The Spirit Ministries International, Bishop Francis Wale-Oke, gave the warning  at the interdenominational church service to mark the 2022 Democracy Day celebration held at the National Christian Centre, Abuja. Speaking on the theme ‘More than Conquerors,’ Ayokunle noted that any party that wishes to produce the next president must not undermine the Christian community. He said, “While I congratulate the candidates, I must sound this warning, please do not fly a Muslim-Muslim ticket. It would not fly. It will not stand. Rather, it would set the nation against each other. “The candidate who will emerge is the one who works with the Church. Please, do not alienate the church. “If you embrace equity, fairness and justice, the Nigerian electorate will reward you with their votes at the polls and they will give you their support.” Reiterating his counsel on equity and fairness, the CAN President said the country cannot claim to practice justice when a certain region is deprived of producing a president. He urged candidates to exalt righteousness in their campaigns saying “You can only rule when there is a nation. In your campaigns, make sure you exalt fairness, justice and equity. If there is no righteousness, fairness and equity, we will remain divided. “There is no fairness if a certain people from a certain ethnic group are reduced to second class citizens who cannot aspire to the highest office in the land. “We pray for an end to killing people in their place of worship. We pray for a nation that is united and where justice, fairness and equity reigns. God bless you all and God bless Nigeria.” In attendance is the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who is representing the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo; Representative of the Senate President and Speaker House of Representatives, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, Deputy Chief Whip of the Federal House of Representatives; Minister of Women Affairs and former Senatorial Aspirant of the APC, Paulen Tallen; President of the Court of Appeal represented by Justice H.S Samani, Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan, Permanent Secretaries of the Ministries of the Federal Capital Territory, Water Resources, Police Affairs, Civil Service Commission.
