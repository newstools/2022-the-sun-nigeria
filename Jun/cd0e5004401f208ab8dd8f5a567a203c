The three Nigeria international players on the books of English Premier League side, Leicester City are facing contrasting future as they get set for the start of preseason training, as per report by owngoalnigeria.com. Last season, Leicester City had the Nigerian trio of Ademola Lookman, Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho, with Lookman on loan from RB Leipzig with an option of signing him permanently at the end of his loan spell. For now, only Ndidi is sure of staying at the club as it was gathered that the club has held talks with his representative over extending his current deal which has two more years to run. Talks on it will accelerate in the coming weeks. Iheanacho ended last season on a high but manager Brendan Rodgers wants a striker of a different profile, hence won’t mind cashing in on the forward if the club gets a bid in the region of €10m. Meanwhile, there has been no communication with RB Leipzig for Lookman, indicating an unwillingness to make the deal permanent. Lookman will return to RB Leipzig but will likely be sold with interest in his services from teams in France reported over the weekend.
