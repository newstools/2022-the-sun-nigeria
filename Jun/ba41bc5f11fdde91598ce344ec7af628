Other players in the team to take Ekong’s place are Kenneth Omeruo, Leon Balogun, Chidozie Awaziem and others. Players who can also do some work in the team are Calvin Bassey who can also play as a left center-back. Ekong is being assessed currently to know the extent of his injury and will undergo further checks.
