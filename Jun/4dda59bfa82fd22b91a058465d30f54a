I want to connect to my fans worldwide. The US tour is next followed by Africa, Australia, Europe etc.” Buga has become the lead song on Apple Music’s top 100 in Nigeria. It is the world’s top five Afrobeats music trending globally, as Shazam also has named it the most Shazam song in the world. Daniel said: “It’s a great feeling. When you put out a masterpiece and the rest of the world accepts it as one, that’s a satisfying feeling right there. And such encourages you to do more.” Buga is described as a beautiful song that lifts the spirit and massages the soul effortlessly. “Buga is a Nigerian parlance. It means ‘show off’, ‘stunt on them’. So, in this context, it means after you’ve put in the work, let your results speak loudly. Enjoy your success. Whatever you’re seeing out there, whatever results the song is generating, that’s the result of hard work and I’ve consistently put in my best in all my songs. Nothing good comes easy,” the artiste reiterated.
