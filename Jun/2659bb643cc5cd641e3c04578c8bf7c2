From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Presidency has finally responded to All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu’s outburst in Abeokuta, last week Thursday, where he said he deserves to lead the country after helping President Muhammadu Buhari win the 2015 election. In a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the Presidency said, although they were those who advised the President to run again; and the APC was the vehicle capable of delivering victory but millions of Nigerians made it a reality, hence, “No one can claim to have made the possible.” The statement read thus: “It is perhaps not surprising that on the eve of the All Progressives Congress (APC) flagbearer primary, there are those running as candidates who wish to associate themselves with the President’s rise to elected office seven years ago. “There are many people who played parts large and small in his historic election in 2015, making history as the first opposition candidate to defeat a sitting president with power changing hands peacefully at the ballot box. “There are those who advised the President to run again; those who decided to build a political party – the APC – that could finally be the political vehicle capable of delivering victory where all other opposition parties and alliances before it had failed. “Those decisions may have been agreed upon by a few. But they were delivered by thousands and voted for by tens of millions. No one can or should claim to have made the possible. “Yet as important as that moment was, it is not what should decide the next general election. “What matters is the future: the policy platforms, the ideas, the drive, and the determination to take over the President’s stewardship of our country and build upon his legacy to make our country better than it has ever been. “The person most demonstrable in those qualities is the one to lead our party and our country forward.”
