We also enjoin the public, especially those with shades of opinions and surge of anxieties to remain calm. “The government hopes to see light at the end of the tunnel. The commissioner reiterated that the state government stands with Ekweremadu at this trying moment. We hope the truth and nothing but the truth shall guide the outcome of the matter,” he said.
