Molly Kilete, Abuja Men of the Inspector-General of police Intelligence Response Team (IRT) have arrested five more suspects in connection with the Offa bank robbery of April 5, where over 33 persons, including police officers, were killed. The five suspects were arrested within the week after the IRT stormed the South West part of the country in continuation of investigations into the robbery. Daily Sun reliably gathered that the team, which temporarily relocated to Kwara State last Sunday, in company with one of the gang’s leaders, dismissed police sergeant Michael Adikwu, made a headway after combing some bushes and operational bases of the group in some states in the South West. Adikwu, who also trained the gang members in handling guns, was also said to have personally shot and killed 22 persons, mostly police personnel at the station during the robbery. Sources at the IRT office in Abuja told Daily Sun that the dismissed sergeant led operatives to the locations and hideouts where the suspects were arrested. The source was, however, silent on the investigation so far carried out on the response of Senate President Bukola Saraki on his alleged involvement in the robbery saga. This is even as Daily Sun gathered that all the arrested suspects have since been transferred to the IRT office in Abuja for further investigation.
