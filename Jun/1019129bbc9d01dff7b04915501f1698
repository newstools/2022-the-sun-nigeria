From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC)/Transparency International (TI) chapter in Nigeria has described as worrisome, the recent recovery of N1.85 billion meant for defence procurement by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC). Executive Director, CISLAC/Head of Transparency International (TI) chapter in Nigeria, Auwal Ibrahim Musa Rafsanjani, in a statement, said the discovery of billions of naira cash alongside other luxurious items at the home of a military contractor, K. Salam Construction Company, has validated its persistent public outcry for transparency and accountability in defence procurement and spending. It said the discovery was a welcome development, especially as the nation’s defence spending has hitherto been buried in absolute secrecy and institutionalised corruption that impede efficient services and nation’s security. CISLAC/TI Nigeria reiterated that defence corruption has done unforgivable damage to political stability, counter-terrorism efforts, socio-economic development and well-being of common Nigerians at all levels. It, therefore, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to open an independent and thorough investigation into the issue as uncovered by ICPC to fully dig deep and expose true source and ownership of the recovered assets/items to ensure the perpetrators and their accomplices are judiciously prosecuted and adequately sanctioned. It also called on President Buhari to ensure this and other reported high profile cases are accorded urgent priority to discourage corrupt practices in the defence and security sector, while building public confidence and a reputable foundation for incoming administration in 2023. It also demanded transparency and accountability in defence spending and targeted investigation by National Assembly into reported unaccounted spending on weapons. It further demanded adequate legislative oversight by relevant committees in the National Assembly into the nation’s defence and security procurement and spending to restore efficiency, transparency and accountability into the sector.
