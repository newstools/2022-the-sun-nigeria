From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri Former military administrator of Delta State, Luke Ochulor, has urged South East to take solace in the emergence of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, insisting that with him all hope is not lost for the zone. Ochulor, who is particularly not happy with the turnout of events with the two leading political parties ceding their presidential tickets to other zones, maintained that since the Delta State governor is of the Igbo tribe, he should not be totally ignored. “South East has not lost on both sides because we still have Okowa as running mate to Atiku, he speaks Igbo, so I can say all hope is not lost,” he said. The elder statesman also faulted the disunity among Igbo politicians and leader in rallying round an aspirant for the entire zone. “Our chances would have been brighter with such arrangement facing any opposition. I had expected that the governors and stakeholders will come together to present a candidate, but as it stands now, all we have to do is pray, Peter Obi is a technocrat, he can manage an economy if he’s given the chance,” Ochulor said.
