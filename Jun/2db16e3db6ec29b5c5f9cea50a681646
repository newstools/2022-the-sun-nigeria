From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu Ohanaeze Ndigbo, yesterday, said it has not abandoned Senator Ike Ekweremadu who is facing trial in the United Kingdom over alleged organ harvest of a minor. The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation debunked insinuations that it has disowned Ekweremadu following his ordeal, attributing the remarks to the handiwork of impostors. A statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the group, Alex Ogbonnia, said while it owed it a duty to stand with its own, especially in times of difficulty, it was, however, not in its character to hurriedly make statements over issues it lacked sufficient facts. Ogbonnia expressed concerns over Miss Sonia Ekweremadu and fervently prayed that Ekweremadu, his wife, Lady Nwanneka and family would overcome the current travails. “It is noteworthy that eminent Igbo patriots have at one time or the other, pleaded with impostors and pretenders to desist from reckless and unguarded statements that portray the Igbo in a bad light using the platform of the Apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide.
