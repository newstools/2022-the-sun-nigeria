The governors elected on the platform of the APC and the party’s National Working Committee had recommended five aspirants for today’s presidential primary of the party while advising the remaining contenders to step down. Those who got the nod of the governors and party leaders to remain in the race are former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu; a former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi and Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo. Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, who disclosed the development on Tuesday morning, had said the list of shortlisted “frontline candidates” has been presented to Buhari, who he said okayed the recommendation. “The president told us any of these five are qualified to be president and have contributed to the party (APC). He said he is comfortable with any of them,” said Lalong. “Our recommendation is to enable us to give direction for the party as we go into the primary. We cannot go with everybody, but in our view, these are the people we think should remain.”
