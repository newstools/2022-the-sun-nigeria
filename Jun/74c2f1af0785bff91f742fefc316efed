The Sun Russia is ready for its first clash of striking superstars – if Reds ace Salah is fit to take on Barcelona’s Suarez, who was banned for biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini at Brazil 2014. Liverpool stars present and past may lock horns with Luis Suarez lining up against Mo Salah if he is fit. Egypt are the most successful African nation, having won the continent’s Cup of Nations seven times, they have a tough opening game against the Group A favourites but second place is a plausible achievement. Uruguay have won the trophy twice but are dwarfed by South American giants Brazil and Argentina these days, with Suarez back though anything can happen – good or bad. No need to look beyond the two forwards, Suarez and Salah. Both have a point to prove for vastly different reasons. Suarez is to regain his dignity and Salah to show he is truly world class. Egypt boss Hector Cuper considers his defensive policy an attribute, appreciating that his team has Premier League stars dotted throughout but they cannot match Uruguay for style. Egypt (4-2-3-1): Elshenewy; Fathi, Gabr, Hegazi, Abdel Shafi; Hamed, Elneny; Sobhi, Said, Warda; Salah Uruguay boss Oscar Tabarez insists all 23 of his players are in ‘tip top’ condition, while he needs a crutch to help him get about at 71 – the oldest coach at the tournament. Uruguay (4-4-2): Muslera; Varela, Gimenez, Godin, Caceres; Nandez, Vecino, Bentancur, De Arrascaeta; Cavani, Suarez. Hadary will become the oldest player in World Cup history if he plays on Friday afternoon. But at 45 years old, is that a good thing or does it show frailties in the squad? Luis Suarez is a brilliant striker but has been mentally unhinged with his three previous biting attacks on opponents.
