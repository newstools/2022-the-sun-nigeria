Reverend Ukpai Kalu of the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria has said the people of Abia North senatorial district and South East geo-political zone would benefit immensely if the Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu is re-elected in 2023. According to the cleric, Kalu has done well to position the Igbo at the centre of political negotiations, applauding the former Abia State governor for his exceptional performance since assuming office as senator representing Abia North senatorial district. He stated this in an interview with journalists, yesterday, at the Sam Mbakwe Airport, Owerri, while reacting to the outcome of the just concluded convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC.) He appealed to the people of Abia North to support and re-elect Kalu for the betterment of the district, saying, “some people were there for decades with zero impact for our people. Kalu has done exceptionally well and I’m using this opportunity to commend him, as well as urge the people of Abia North senatorial district to continue to entrust the affairs of the zone to him. “Although I am not a politician, you have to accept it if somebody does well. I can assure you that Senator Orji Uzor Kalu has done excellently since he was elected in 2019. Our people in Abia North senatorial district, Abia State and Ndigbo in general stand to benefit more if he is re-elected to represent the district. “We must unanimously support him because he has done so much by attracting development to Abia North through road projects, renovation of schools and other basic amenities. More benefits will come if he is re-elected, that’s the expectation. Those trying to challenge him should step down immediately because we don’t want any form of backwardness,” he said.
