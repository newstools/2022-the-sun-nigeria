According him, he received his first break as a teenager with Tonix World of Fashion, Benin, Edo State in 2013/2014, and took part in runway shows and other modeling competitions. “I felt excited and glad that I was shortlisted among the top 10 in Dreams Models Next International competition 2022/2023. Honestly, I felt my dreams were beginning to unfold. I faced many challenges, even discouragement before getting into the top 10. It wasn’t easy convincing my fans to vote for me. They all believed I wasn’t serious, but when they saw proofs that I wasn’t joking, I started having support from many of them,” he said.
