The Igbo World Union (IWU) has assured President Muhammadu Buhari of support in Saturday’s presidential election, and has urged him to make some projects in the South East top priority. Speaking during a courtesy visit to the Presidential Villa in Abuja, leader of the group, Gburugburu Ndigbo Dum, Sir Mishak Nnanta, last Friday, commended president Buhari for carefully piloting the state affairs; at a time of economic recession, terrorism and crimes of varying degrees. He said although Buhari inherited huge problems, he has been able to put back the country on recovery and progress. Nnanta said the Buhari government has given special priority to agriculture, which will ensure food sufficiency. He also commended the government for its welfare programmes for school children, while congratulating it for fighting corruption in all facets of the society. IWU, however, urged president Buhari to address some issues “hampering civilisation, trade and commerce in the eastern corridor of Nigeria.” Listing what should be looked into, Nnanta said the Federal Government should do everything needed to make Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, to operate at full capacity and also, called for the resuscitation and rehabilitation of the abandoned Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, depot, at Emene, also in Enugu. In his response, president Buhari thanked the delegation for the visit and their dedicated patriotism in the pursuit of peaceful co-existence in the country.
