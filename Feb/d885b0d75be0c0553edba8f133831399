President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday promised to open up Taraba State for investors so that its enormous natural resources can be tapped for development. President Buhari made the promise while addressing thousands of supporters at the Jolly Nyame Stadium in Jalingo the state capital, as part of his presidential campaign tour of states. The president said that he would not only ensure the completion of the Mambilla Dam and Ibi bridge but would ensure the construction of the Makurdi-Taraba-Borno rail project that would help to open up the state to other parts of the country for both local and foreign investors. “Taraba State has a lot of potentials that remain untapped. What we need to do is to open up the state to both local and foreign investors. We would complete the Mambilla Dam project that we started after it was ignored for several decades. We would also complete the bridge across the stretch of River Benue in Ibi Local Government Area. “We will also construct a railway line from Benue to Taraba up to Borno State to ease the movement of goods and farm produce. We would ensure that the state is open to enormous development.” The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba State Alh Sani, Abubakar Danladi who appreciated the people for their unwavering loyalty to the party said that Taraba State was in dire need of development and assured that since the current administration had failed in providing that, his regime would correct all the issues that had held the state backward over the years. Our correspondent reports that several persons were allegedly injured by the crowd that turned out in their thousands and was clamouring to have a glimpse of the president.
