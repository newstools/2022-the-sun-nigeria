The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ibadan Zonal Office yesterday arraigned Mary Maisirat Akerele, on a five count charge bordering on stealing to the tune of N35,520,000:00 before Justice Abiodun Akinyemi of the Ogun State High Court 4,Abeokuta. Trouble started for the 46-years-old socialite, who resides in Aseko area of Idiroko Ogun State, when the EFCC received a petition, alleging that she collected the said sum in installments from Alhaja Oladoja Abike,for the purpose of supplying four truck-load of rice from a rice milling company at Bida, Niger State, but diverted the funds. One of the charge reads: “That you Mary Masirat Akerele trading under the name and style of Goodness of Jesus Global Ventures on or about the 19th day of September, 2018 at Abeokuta within the Abeokuta Judicial Division of the Honourable Court, fraudulently converted to the your own use the sum of N11, 000,000.00 only, property of Fausia Abike Oladoja and thereby committed an offence of stealing contrary to Section 390(9) of the Criminal Code, Cap. 30, laws of Ogun State, 2006”. The defendant pleaded ‘not guilty’ when the charge was read to her. Counsel to the defendant, H. A Omikunle made an oral application for his client’s bail. However, Shamsuddeen Bashir, counsel to EFCC, opposed the application due to the defendant’s failure to keep the terms of the administrative bail earlier granted her. Justice Akinyemi adjourned the case till March 4 for determination of the bail application an ordered the remand of the defendant in the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Ibara,Abeokuta
