It was a blissful night to remember as men and women of different fields of endeavor gathered at the Sports Club in Lekki, away from the hustle and bustle that greets them every day to celebrate life- Life as a journey. One would have mistaken the gathering of such people as a normal gathering as sounds of soul searching music graced the venue while people showcased their innate talents. Speaking to Daily Sun on the purpose of the gathering, the host of the event, Barrister Elviris said that it was necessary to get people to understand the role of education in the society through leisure. “The essence of organizing this get-together is to get people in their numbers who have acquired formal education to see the need of passing down what they have learnt to those who are not privileged to acquire formal education in the country. “It is about using leisure as a platform to raise awareness. Literacy Integration and Formal Education Foundation (LIFE) was created as a response to the societal need for formal education in Nigeria. Imagine when 10.5 million children are uneducated, it would be a time bomb waiting to explode and if we do not do something about it now in our generation, we would have a lot of explanation to give our children,” she said. A beneficiary of the foundation, Chikudi Nwagu, expressed delight and gratitude as he thanked the founders and sponsors for giving him the opportunity to experience formal education. He urged the government to put more emphasis on education as it is the only key to curbing insurgency in the country. L.I.F.E is a non governmental organization that helps non-privileged children fulfil their potential in life by providing them access to quality formal education.
