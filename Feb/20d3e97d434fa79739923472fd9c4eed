Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja The European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES) said it  has, so far, expended over €200,000 to support the 2019 elections in the country. ECES Project Advisor, Gender and Inclusion, Cathy Latiwa, made the disclosure, yesterday, in Abuja, during an interactive session with newsmen. Latiwa  said, in preparation for the forthcoming elections, ECES carried out nine activities across the six geopolitical zones and in some specific states in the country. “We went to the six geopolitical zones and different states. So, I’m including all the activities that were done in gender. It is around €200,000, a bit more,” Latiwa said. She further said EU’s interest in Nigeria is as a result of the country being a large country and a force to reckon with in Africa. The EU advisor  added that the union’s interest is to support the country in different areas, so as not to change the system. It said  that was the reason the EU put €20 million in the governance and democracy in Nigeria. She also said ECES is also being funded by the EU in carrying out the same projects in Senegal and other countries. “Women’s participation has improved since few years. We were in Senegal as well. So, we were in different African countries and Nigeria is one of the most important economic power of Africa after DRC and others,” she also said. Earlier, Latiwa said apart from ECES’ support to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), it is, also, in over 20 countries in the world.
