NAN France will for now not act on U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for European allies to repatriate hundreds of Islamic State fighters from Syria, taking back militants on a “case-by-case” basis. France Justice Minister, Nicole Belloubet said on Monday in Paris. U.S.-backed fighters appear poised to capture Islamic State’s last enclave in Syria and Trump on Saturday pressed France, Britain and Germany to bring home over 800 captured Islamic State fighters and put them on trial. Trump has however sworn to pull U.S. forces from Syria after Islamic State’s territorial defeat. The pullout has raised concerns in Paris and other European capitals that jihadists from their countries can disperse and try to return to their home countries. “There is a new geo-political context with the U.S. withdrawal. “For the time being, we are not changing our policy. “At this stage, France is not responding to (Trump’s) demands,” Belloubet told France 2 television.
