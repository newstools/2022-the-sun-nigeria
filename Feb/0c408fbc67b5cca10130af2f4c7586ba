Technical Director of the Nigeria Football Federation, Bitrus Bewarang, has advised Manchester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho not be discouraged over his lack of playing opportunities at the Premier League powerhouse. City manager Pep Guardiola has lost faith in the abilities of the Super Eagles rising star, with his last appearance coming against Everton on January 15, or in other words he has not been involved in the last seven matches contested by the Etihad outfit across all competitions. “I want to encourage Iheanacho to work hard, it is not easy at that level and he should not be discouraged, ” said Bewarang to allnigeriasoccer.com. “It happened to Iwobi before he was brought to the main team of Arsenal, he was brought on ten, fifteen minutes, now he is playing the full game. “It is about determination if they brought someone in his place. They want him to work hard and get more matured.” Bewarang has hinted that Iheanacho may lose his spot in the national team if his situation does not improve as Super Eagles coach Rohr wants his players to feature regularly for their foreign clubs. “The coach wants his players to be play regularly and also playing in well established teams, so when he needs them they will be there for him. Kelechi should not move to China. “Our prayer is let our players get playing time, that is the mentality of the coach, ” concluded Bitrus Bewarang. Things are looking positive for Iheanacho at the moment as he has made the last two matchday squads announced by the Citizens coach, after he was omitted against Spurs, West Ham, Swansea, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace.
