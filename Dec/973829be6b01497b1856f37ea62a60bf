Gospel artistes in Lagos took time out to share the love and joy of the season with the less privileged last Monday, in a programme tagged ‘Love at Christmas’. The artistes, under the auspices of Fellowship of Gospel Music Ministers of Nigeria (FOGMMON), arrived Bethesda Home for the Blind, Surulere, Lagos in a convoy and brandishing gift items. Handing over the gift items to the inmates, chairman of the artistes body, Aity Dennis, said she was glad that they came to spend such a rewarding time with the Home, as caring for the less privileged is one of the core tenets of the Christian faith. The artistes were indeed amazed at the joy the inmates exuded in spite of their challenging condition. One of the musicians, Juli Makpo, enthused: “We are all still speechless and dumbfounded. We thought we wanted to put smiles on their faces, but they were the ones who ended up putting smiles and joy in our faces and hearts. I have had a paradigm shift, I am greatly touched.” The inmates who enjoyed a wonderful dance session led by gospel star, Kenny Saint Best appealed for support from the artistes to enable them further their education as well as the opportunity to feature in the concerts hosted by the musicians.
