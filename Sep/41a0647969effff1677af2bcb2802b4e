The command’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Ibrahim Idris, disclosed this while parading the suspects before newsmen in Kano on Saturday. He alleged that the suspects were arrested on Friday (Sallah day) while in possession of dangerous weapons such as cutlasses, swords, knives and clubs following a tip-off. “The suspects were apprehended by operatives of NSCDC at Yankatsari village carrying dangerous weapons while trying to cause trouble in the area,” he said.
