Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of NCC, Prof. Umar Dambatta, disclosed this during the NCC Day at the 33rd Enugu International Trade Fair complex, Enugu. “Although, the deployment will start from the state capital and gradually extends to other areas across the state, it is important to state that, unlike 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G, the 5G network will bring substantial network improvements, including higher connection speed, mobility and capacity, as well as low-latency capabilities to communications services in Nigeria for business and help to further open up Nigeria in the merging global market.” Represented by Ogbonnaya Ugama, Enugu Zonal Controller of the organisation, the NCC boss said the commission would continue to drive the remarkable digital transformation being witnessed in the economy today even as it would also to pay greater priority to how consumers are treated by the service providers.
