Farm produce worth millions of Naira were destroyed by a fire outbreak at Dangwaleri village of Birniwa local government council of Jigawa State. According to eyewitness account, the fire occurred on Friday at about 3:30 am and destroyed 10 silos. Malam Yahaya Muhammad, the Ward Head in the area, said the fire destroyed food commodities such as millet and sorghum. Muhammad said that the fire started from one of the silos and engulfed the remaining. “The fire destroyed the silos within a short time due to its magnitude, which was beyond our control. “No life was lost but we have nothing left to feed our families,” he said. According to him, the food items in the stores were preserved by the villagers for their households. Muhammad called on the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to assist the victims to cushion the effect of the loss. Commenting on the situation, Alhaji Jaji Dole, an official of the council, described the damaged as “colossal”. Jaji called on wealthy individuals to assist the victims of the fire disaster. (NAN)
