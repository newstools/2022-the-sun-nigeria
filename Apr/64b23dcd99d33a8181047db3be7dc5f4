From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan The Prelate, Methodist Church Nigeria, Most Rev’d Kanu Uche, has directed members of the denomination in their millions across the country that are 18 years and above to get or validate their permanent voter cards (PVCs) ahead of the 2023 general elections. He made this known in his message to the four-day 60th Synod of the Ibadan Diocese of the church, which will end on Sunday. The synod with the theme: ‘Prepare for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ’, is being hosted by the Agbeni Circuit of the diocese, under the presbytership of Very Rev’d Oluyinka Akande, at the Methodist Cathedral, Agbeni, Ibadan, Oyo State. According to Uche, “For us to enthrone an honest government, each Methodist, who is 18 years and above, must get a Permanent Voter Card (PVC), and validate it. At the same time, if our desire is to enthrone a righteous administration, none of us must collect money before voting. In this way, we will help enthrone an administration that will usher in adequate security, and economic buoyancy, which would enable us to enjoin the full dividends of democracy in Nigeria.” The Prelate also noted that “many  people in leadership are insincere to the plights of citizens, since they are not holding public trust with the spirit of servanthood. They are not ready to serve, except to ‘serve selfishly.’ Who would save Nigeria from this present crop of leadership in both public and private sectors, especially now that we are preparing for 2023 elections? In my view the answer is God. I say this because we have had qualitative leadership in the past and a few of such among the present crop.”
