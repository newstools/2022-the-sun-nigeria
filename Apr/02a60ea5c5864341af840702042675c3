From Emmanuel Adeyemi, Lokoja MEMBER representing Kabba Bunu/Ijumu Federal constituency at the National Assembly, Hon. Tajudeen Yusuf, yesterday told the contractor handling the renovation of Kabba-Okene road to ensure that he delivers on the job in line with the specification of the contract.   Yusuf, who is a member of the House of Representatives Committee on Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA), gave the charge while inspecting the level of work done on the 34-kilometre road, in company with some FERMA engineers led by Engineer Mohammed Ibrahim.   He said the road, which was first constructed in 1982 by then governor Adamu Attah of the old Kwara State, was very important as it links the North-central with parts of the South-west.   He said the bad portions of the road were black spots where men of the under world unleashed terror on innocent motorists, saying that was one of the reasons members of the National Assembly from the area pressured the Federal Government to fix the road.   Yusuf, who inspected the road close to Kabba town, said he noticed some isolated areas where quality job was not done, noting that he would not compromise his oversight function for any reason. Responding, the representative of the contractor, Engineer Segun Olowu, gave the assurance that the company would do a good job. He said the road was awarded at the cost of N175 million to be completed within six months, which terminates this month.   Yusuf also inspected the Kabba-Omuo high way, which is being rehabilitated by, Romka Nig Ltd.
