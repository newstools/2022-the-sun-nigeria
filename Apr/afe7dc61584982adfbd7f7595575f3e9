From Tony Osauzo, Benin AN All Progressives Congress, (APC ) governorship aspirant in Edo State and Chairman of the State’s Economic Team, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has revealed plans to restore sporting activities in the state as a way of creating jobs for youths. He announced this on Sunday at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium during the Edo Football Association Final Match between Inneh Football Club and Dynamite Football Club of Benin where the former defeated the latter 3-0. He said if elected governor, his administration would formulate policy to ensure that people involved in sports were supported and funded adequately describing as disturbing, the little support for sports by individuals and companies in the state. “It is very exciting for us and the whole sport industry is something we must encourage. You know part of our agenda is to create jobs and we see sport as an opportunity to create lots of jobs. You can see the energetic young men, very talented and fit, the way they have played is something we must encourage and sustain. “What is distressing is that the resources required is not a lot and when I inquired how much it will cost to support a club it was less than N5 million a year and that I am sure can be afforded by individuals and companies in Edo State.
