From Noah Ebije, Kaduna Kaduna Central District Senator Uba Sani’s bid to occupy Kashim Ibrahim House, Kaduna received a new impetus Thursday as he obtained the Governorship Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The senator was accompanied by top party chieftains from Kaduna State, key political associates, friends, well-wishers and teams of enthusiastic supporters. ‘We were warmly received at the APC Secretariat by the National Organising Secretary, Sulaiman Mohammed Argungu,’ an elated Sani said. In his remarks at the brief ceremony, Uba Sani reiterated the pledge to sustain and build on the legacies of Governor Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai, whom he described as an innovative and resourceful man who has redefined governance through his unrivalled infrastructural and human capital development in Kaduna State. ‘My profound appreciation to top chieftains of our party, political associates, friends and well-wishers for sparing time to accompany me to collect the forms,’ Sani said. The senator called on citizens of Kaduna State to join in the ‘journey of consolidation and continuity.’
