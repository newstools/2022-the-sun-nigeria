By Monica Iheakam  Super Eagles star, Wilfred Ndidi will be staying with Leicester City for a long time so said manager Craig Shakespeare. The young Nigerian’s impressive start to the Premier League had made him the bride in England, with  several big clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham falling over themselves to woo him. The 20-year-old  who signed from Genk in a £15million deal during the January window, now commands much higher fee as a result of his displays and the anchor of Leicester midfield.  Ndidi’s profile shot higher  after  he scored  a second wonder goal from long range against Stoke on Saturday, following on from a similar strike in the FA Cup win over Derby County. According to Daily mail of London, Shakespeare was not ready to put pressure or part with the young Nigerian international,  whom he described as one of his best players for any fee. “Ndidi is with us for a long time on a long-term contract. We want to keep our best players, of which he is one. Shakespeare began. ‘We can do nothing about speculation. It is a credit to him, in terms of the way he has performed. But also the way he is. He is a very good professional, very mature head on his shoulders. ‘I have no problem with speculation, but we have our best players tied up. Of course, there can always be bids, we can always turn them down. Football is football, you’ll always get bids for good players. ‘Speaking to Wilfred, he is very happy here. He knows that we have given him the opportunity and I am sure that hopefully he will be a player here for a long, long time. ‘Because of his age, I’m reluctant to put too much expectation on him. He’s only 20 but looks tailor-made for the Premier League.”
