Scented Offal We could swear that our loins never Joined From old times In the rhythms Of dances Or in accents Or in songs Or in the patterns of the village square Or the way kings hollered In the marketplace We could deny the hue in which our ancestors clothed their Gods Or mourned Or let libations drop Or in the rains Or the pithy moments of surrender To the unyielding wills of prophesies Even if we forswore our bonds or embraces We could never deny the blood they spilled Out of gourds of war The blood of our brothers The saliva of sisters The teary treasure of friends The blood that answered the cries of slaughter Our blood, flowing with zest And intoning in gushes The voices that are ours In this blood we saw the cousin Who is us but who is not The blood of the Yoruba spliced with The arteries of the Afemai, The jugular of the Igbo speaking half-accented Fulani Suddenly we turn blind with our bold faces By lying about our blood ties We inhabit a brood of denial In that dawn of independence The bards wept over a deflowered shoot But the rythms and the songs inspired Wiggles of multi-ethnic ectacy Show me your Itsekiri dance Or show me the Ijaw minstrel and I will see The lineaments of Yoruba beauty But for so for us We have inaugurated a confusion As though ancestrally ordained We joy in a babel more comfounded Than when the Old Testament propounded Many tongues to excite a lonely race But we are born from The snap and flare of conflict In blood shed and shared We fought for land and brides Fierce and fuzzy like prides of lions We cowered kings of fellow kinsmen we named foes Slaves fell who became fathers under our eaves They bore girls craved by kings Loins teased slaves into freeborn royalty Bonded yesterday, blue blood thereafter So fluid was our kinship We never were a race until war made us We wrestled into one Even the Yoruba In the nineteenth century Dueled into brotherhood Kiriji, Latosa, Ekitiparapo, Kurunmi Made myth out of spears and fears The Bini never bowed to a foreign invader But drew majesty out of travesty To mark Their place in the pantheon Historians call it massacre But the indigenes Who fell because they marched Rename it resistance Though futile They wove pride out of their pyre Not far away Inch by inch Nana inked his Itsekiri print In blood and strife They all fought for a country they Did not know grew limbs In sacrifices Dripped as blood Dribbled on maps hourglass shaped. From their rapine spears What can we say of the warriors of Jukun With eyes and skins skeined in The lore of warriors When Nigeria came The tribes embraced with averted faces Suffocating bear hugs Nigeria was not even known then No one named it Nor craved for it They did not even own it Its fruits were Nourished in foreign ether White hosts hoisting guns with a god.     Y.J. ITOPA YJ Itopa, a poet and journalist hails from Ihima, Okehi Local Government Area of Kogi State. Itopa wrote the song to mourn an Ebira sibling of his, Adinoyi Ojo-Onukaba, who died last month in an inexplicable armed robbery attack on his return from Abeokuta where he attended the inauguration of a presidential library owned by Nigerian Former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, his friend and associate. Lament for Arrow Onukaba The world had seasoned the arrow with holly poison And was luring the lair with fair stalking O death has plucked the laurel from the quiver? Owner of plenty powerful plays You also have furnished the field with bejeweled Journalism A playwright that sired works of luminous plumage for which Kings visited you with royal staves to hail your name as hallowed While Gods’ divine feathers are hoisted in your crowded crown Owner of a mighty mind For our planting You have sought the sun to suckle the seeds we spread And for our night to be benign to night You became kind like a sky Seeking the moon to make a lasting lantern And this gave you The Fire fly in a sullen sky medal A mighty man of bounteous missionary bone You have swollen the sea To cool the canal To spread her countless tentacles To make verdure of a miserable meadow For which you are now the Oasis of a flaccid flora and fauna The world had seasoned the arrow with holly poison And was luring the lair with fair stalking O death has plucked the laurel from the quiver? Humbled by sincere civilisation From your toothsome travels around the world You returned to meet in every vein a deadly decay And this decay you stubbornly fought to Plant your banner saddle on the sterile polity of the land Was it not with the speed of light They turned your flaming flag to shamed shreds? And the pieces Looking like useless pile in a tailor’s shop? I remember how they kissed their coffin: To vote for a man of panting pocket is suicidal He had worked with many wealth weaving looms Around the world He had formed a federal government with people of power And sat with the most opulent And saw where wealth was born, bred and Drained in sky-piercing silos Yet he scratches the soil for miserable grains like a compound cock To vote for a man of panting pocket is suicidal Who will teach this Onukaba the saint To know the election here is bargained and bought Cheaply like weevil owned bowls of beans A trade where the highest bidder buys our conscience Bidding us a four year old farewell Who will tell this Onukaba the saint? Is it a crime to serve without blemish Is it a crime to work for welfare of citizens Is it a crime to plant good tree for morrow’s men? You had always wondered before you left the quiver. The world had seasoned the arrow with holly poison And was luring the lair with fair stalking O death has plucked the laurel from the quiver? O death of many killing devices In our case today you came In a formidable form In the form of armed robbers, the owners of all our roads In the form of an escaping car veering off the road With a mission to end a golden life returning from knowledge hunting He saw your sign and sought safety in the bosom of a far flung forest Yet…. Some deaths are dressed in naked mystery colour A bare termite has eaten the grain and the hoe The world had seasoned the arrow with holly poison And was luring the lair with fair stalking O death has plucked the laurel from the quiver? I wonder why we know our heroes when we No longer can see our heroes When idols are dead Onto the spreading arms of the sky we hurl our Heroes’ songs drums and dances: We regret we didn’t make a sincere son the king We have invited a ruinous reign on our head We have used our needle to sew our shroud We knew you were the ideal arrow in the bow of God We knew you were sublime in thoughts and deeds We have gone to war without armour Killing our conscience on the altar of quick but baited gains Ah! The fish has swallowed a homing hook Onukaba is gone The quiver is emptied of a prized possession O the arrow is gone and the sky has sorrowed Drowning the earth from sole to scalp Mourning with thunder clap Mourning with flashes of lightening tears The mother has halted her tears for the one she felt beholden to To travel home in peace and peat The arrow we seasoned for the lair is gone And we wept till the end of time When we see the savanna, o come and see the savanna When we behold its beatific hills and their jubilant ants When we wonder how the ants mould their mud for the shelter When we wonder how the ants sink the stream for the hill work Then we know Ihineba remembers every grain of His sands The world had seasoned the arrow with holly poison And was luring the lair with fair stalking O death has plucked the laurel from the quiver?
