By Chinelo Obogo, Lagos The leader of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Ralph Uwazuruike, on Saturday, led thousands of youths in Imo on a solidarity march in support of the presidential ambition of the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello. The youths, who started the procession from the MASSOB leader’s House in Owerri, marched through the streets, carrying different placards, with inscriptions such as “Power to the Youths, Support Yahaya Bello”, “Youths Can Also Lead”, and “Yahaya Bello for the Youths”, among others. They said that the only solution to Nigeria’s political quagmire was for power to go to the youths. According to them, in this regard, Governor Bello is the right fit for the position of President of the country. Recall that Bello picked his Expression of Interest and Nomination forms at the All Progressives Congress (APC) national secretarial on Wednesday. Bello, who was the first to pay the N100 million required for the forms, was received by a crowd of party faithfuls and support groups from across the country, who have been urging him to run for President. Uwazuruike, who advised Nigerians and party leaders to shun zoning, saying it had no place in the constitution of Nigeria, said MASSOB would support Governor Bello to become the next president of Nigeria because he has the leadership qualities to lead Nigeria effectively. He noted that power should go to the best in the race, adding that the Kogi State Governor was the best for the job. “All Nigerians should rally round the youthful Governor, Yahaya Bello. Today, April 30, 2022 is all about Nigerian youths. We are supporting Yahaya Bello for this and no one else. That he has the capacity to solve the problem of insecurity and a host of others facing the nation is not in doubt. “This is a crucial time in the history of the country. We must give youths a chance, especially one that has demonstrated uncommon capacity, in the person of Yahaya Bello,” he said. Uwazuruike, who is also the Founder of Biafran Independent Movement (BIM), insisted that the contest should be thrown open. Addressing the crowd of people that had come to welcome him at the APC Secretariat last Wednesday, Bello had said, “Right now, what we have ahead of us is a task of canvassing and consulting all party faithfuls, leaders, delegates and stalwarts, members and all Nigerians, at home and even in the diaspora to support us so that we become the flagbearer of this great party come 30 and 31 of May 2022. By the special grace of God, I am confident I shall become victorious and the party shall become victorious. “I am coming to restore hope for Nigerians, for the entire black Africans and for the entire black nation across the world. That is the hope that we are coming on board with. To Unite, to secure, and to put the country and our people on the path of prosperity.”
