Tosin Ajirire, South Africa As the curtain is drawn on the Big Brother Naija reality TV show today, the question on everyone’s lip is: who wins the grand prize of N45 million? Is it Tobi, Cee C, Nina, Alex or Miracle?  The final week has been full of clashes and tension with the last Sunday’s live show capping it with more intriguing and emotional moments. However, the highpoint of it all was Cee C getting a ‘strike’ after her ‘yabis’ bout with ex-lover, Tobi.  Today, in far away South Africa, the show will be shut down with a bang with Afropop star, Davido thrilling the live audience and viewers across the continent.
