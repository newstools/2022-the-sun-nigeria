Tiger Woods plans to compete in the 86th Masters, less than 14 months after suffering serious injuries in a horrific car crash in February 2021. The 15-time major winner, who feared shortly after the accident that his right leg would have to be amputated, has not contested a top-level event since the 2020 Masters, which was played in November that year. The 46-year-old, who competed in the PNC Championship with son, Charlie, in December, played a practice round at Augusta last week and nine holes on both Sunday and Monday.  “As of right now I feel like I am going to play,” Woods said in his pre-tournament press conference. Asked if he thought he could win a 16th major title this week, Woods said: “I do.” Asked what his overriding emotion was on being able to compete at Augusta, Woods said: “Thankful. Very, very thankful for everyone’s support, everyone who has been involved in my process and the work I have put in each and every day.  “The amount of texts and FaceTimes and calls I have gotten has meant a lot.” Woods said he had been driven by his desire to compete and win again, adding: “I feel like if I can still compete at the highest level I am going to, but if I feel like I can’t, you won’t see me out here.
