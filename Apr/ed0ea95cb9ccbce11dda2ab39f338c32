From Lateef Dada, Osogbo A university lecturer, Clara Portela, has posited that sanction is necessary and effective in reducing tension. She noted that the sanction by the European Union and United Nations was to create peace and to prevent further destruction of property. Portela who was once a Senior Associate Analyst at the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) and faculty member in Political Science at the University of Valencia (Spain), stated this at Osun State University (UNIOSUN), during the Webinar on Sanctions and International Security: Russia’s War in Ukraine, Western Democracies and Global Peace. The programme, organized by the Global Affairs and Sustainable Development Institute (GASDI), UNIOSUN, also had Professor Thomas Biersteker, as a co-speaker. In his welcome address, the Vice-Chancellor of UNIOSUN, Prof Odunayo Adebooye, noted that GASDI was established with a mandate to address issues of Sustainable Development in unique and effective ways that can fast-track the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ‘In accordance with its mandate, and growing concern by the university community about the negative impact of the war in Ukraine on the achievement of the SDGs, the GASDI conceived this webinar as a forum for promoting local and international understanding of the role that sanctions by Western democracies could play in ending the war and its pernicious consequences,’ he stated.
