I also want everyone to know that I have forgiven those who offended us and at the same time I want those we offended to forgive us because God Has purified my heart and I am still alive and grateful to Almighty Allah for that. I can die now or tomorrow, I am thankful to Allah for all my life. ‘To all those who offended us, I am using this opportunity to say that I have forgiven them all. I hope we shall forgive each other and God will forgive us all,’ she said. The former First Lady used the occasion to pray for peace and unity in the country. She also prayed for economic growth and development in the country while lamenting the security challenges bedevilling the country.

May the Almighty Allah bless Nigeria and all Nigerians, Amen,’ the statement read.
