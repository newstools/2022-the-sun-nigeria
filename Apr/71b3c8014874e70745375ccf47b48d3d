From Joe Effiong, Uyo A communal clash between the Ilaje (Yoruba) people and natives of Ibeno Local Government Area (LGA) of Akwa Ibom has led to the death of several people and the destruction of properties worth millions of naira in their fishing settlement. Daily Sun learned from a community source that the number of casualties on both sides was high even as he could not ascertain the number of death as at the time of filing this report He said the cause of the fatal clash was still hazy, but averred that it could have been as a result of cult war which allegedly led to the stabbing to death of an indigene of the community, which sparked off the fracas before it assumed an ethnic dimension. He added that the Ilaje people, mostly fishermen, had started fleeing the community  through bush paths, while their houses and tents were being looted and destroyed by hoodlums. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon (SP), when contacted, simply said he was not aware of the crisis, but would find out.
