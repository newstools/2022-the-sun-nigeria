By Chinelo Obogo Presiding Bishop of Living Faith Church Worldwide, David Oyedepo, has said he had always known that Nigeria was heading for a Waterloo under the current administration. Speaking during Easter service in Ota, Ogun State, the cleric, who has been a vocal critic of President Muhammadu Buhari, said he is privileged to know that Nigeria was not headed in the right direction because God confided in him what would become of the country. He said this just as the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Mathew Kukah, in his Easter message accused President Muhammadu Buhari of  destroying every aspect of life in Nigeria, allowing corruption to thrive and dividing citizens. Oyedepo said he stopped speaking on the issues in the country because in the past, he had frequently warned about what would befall the country but no one listened to him. He also said that he has no interest in politics because he has taken a strong position in Christ. “There are people God confides Himself in, not because of experience or age but because of their heart for Him. David dictated the process of crucifixion and its outcome. He was a king, He was not a preacher but a man with a heart for God. I knew Nigeria was heading for a waterloo. He confided in me. “They are under torture. Somebody commented recently, you know why Bishop stopped? He shouted and shouted, but they didn’t hear. What will I ever get from it? Will I get elected from it?  “I knew that in 1984, there is no position on this earth that I will fight for. I have taken a strong position in Christ. Now they are going again, deceiving you, what a people with a short memory,” he said.
