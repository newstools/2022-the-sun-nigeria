From Molly Kilete, Abuja The Defence and Police Officers Wives Association (DEPOWA) on Friday distributed food items to fifty widows of soldiers killed in the counter-insurgency war and other internal security operations across the country. The food items include ten kilogrammes of rice, millet, packs of Indomie noodles, beverages, and cash among other items. Presenting the food items to the widows DEPOWA president Mrs Anwuli Irabor, while commiserating with the widows over the loss of their breadwinners, said the items and the cash were to alleviate the hardship the widows were going through and to encourage them to remain strong for their children.

Responding on behalf of the widows, Mrs Blessing Ibrahim thanked the DEPOWA president for the gifts and for always caring for the widows of fallen heroes and prayed to God to continue to protect officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Armed Forces.
