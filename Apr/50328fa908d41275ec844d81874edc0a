From Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has bemoaned the deaths and injuries caused by an inferno that occurred at the Bonny-Bille jetty on Monday. Governor Wike said he was deeply saddened to learn of the casualties and extensive damage to property caused by the unfortunate incident. ‘On behalf of the Government of Rivers State, I would like to offer my sincere prayers for the victims of the fire incident and extend my deepest condolences to their families. I would also like to sincerely pray for early recovery of those who were injured,’ the governor stated. The governor urged the State Police Command and other relevant security agencies to investigate and unravel the exact cause of this catastrophe. The fire outbreak had occurred at the popular jetty on Monday morning recording no fewer than five lives including two pregnant women and a baby. The inferno reportedly burnt about 60 boats and destroyed several other properties too much to quantify.
