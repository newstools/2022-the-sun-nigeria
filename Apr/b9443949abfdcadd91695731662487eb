From Tony Osauzo, Benin Ahead of the 2023 general election, former governor of Edo State and former national chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, yesterday, declared his intention to contest election into the Senate to represent Edo North senatorial district. His declaration, which confirmed earlier speculation of his ambition to contest the Senate seat, came as he marked his 70th birthday at his Iyamoh residence in Etsako West Local Government Area that had several leaders of the APC in attendance. Oshiomhole explained that he chose to celebrate his birthday with his people because he was conscious of his origin as a nobody given birth to under a tree by his mother but destined by God to be what he is today. “It is true that for quite sometimes, many of our people have asked me why don’t you contest for the Senate and I said first APC has crisis, let us fix the crisis, let there be convention because you cannot begin to discuss what kind of baby you are going to have when you are not married.  “I said until APC is fixed, you cannot talk of contesting election using the platform. “I have been chairman of the party, I know the danger we face if we are not able to fix the party and this was completed and consummated on March 28, and we have now elected a brand new National Working Committee and a brand new National Executive Council under the able leadership.”
