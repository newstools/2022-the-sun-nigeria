Government College Ibadan Old Boys’ Association (GCIOBA) has said the proposed transfer of the running of the school to it will not affect the free education policy of the Oyo State Government. The association stated this on Thursday in a statement by its Vice President, Mr. Tola Obembe. Obembe in the press statement said highlights of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) GCIOBA signed with the state government included retaining the free education policies of the government of Oyo State which states very clearly that no tuition fees would be paid by the students of the school; the Governing Board of the school would be responsible for the administration of the school and would include representatives of Oyo State Government and the Parents Teachers Association (PTA); the Old Boys would continue to develop the infrastructure of the school on which they have already spent over N2 billion and it would also improve the teaching methods of the school and train staff.
