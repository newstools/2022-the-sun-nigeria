By Sylvanus Viashima, Jalingo The Speaker of the Taraba State House of Assembly, Prof Albasu Kunini, has condemned the recent bomb blast in Iware Ardo Kola Local Government of the state that claimed no fewer than five lives and left many injured. Kunini who expressed his disdain over the act during plenary at the state House of Assembly on Wednesday said the act was bestial and inhuman and uncalled for. “This disdainful and dastardly act by the miscreants came at the time when the State Government has been doing everything humanly possible for peace to reign in the State and ensure the security of lives and property of the people. “Security agencies must brace up to tackle the ugly trend head-on, because the State, hitherto described as the most peaceful in the North East geopolitical Zone, cannot afford to witness the carnage and new wave of terrorism. “I call on Tarabans to be vigilant and conscious of the people they relate with, as well as report suspicious persons to the appropriate authorities, especially with the commencement of the electioneering campaigns,” he said. Kunini consoled the people Ardo Kola Local Government Area, the District Head of Iware and the State government on the ugly incident. Daily Sun recalls that an Improvised explosive device detonated yesterday at the popular cattle market killing about six persons and leaving dozens with various degrees of injuries.
