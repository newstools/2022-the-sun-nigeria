From Noah Ebije, Kaduna Barely two weeks after terrorists attacked an Abuja-Kaduna bound train, killing and abducting passengers, relatives of the hostages taken have appealed to the Federal Government to negotiate with their abductors for the release of their loved ones. Over 20 relatives of the abductees on Monday gathered in Kaduna and held private discussions regarding the fate of the hostages. Speaking to Daily Sun shortly after their meeting, the leader of the group, Joseph Daudu (real name withheld), said that in the last communication they had with the abductors they had requested that the Federal Government should talk to them and not the parents of the victims. ‘It is not a new thing in this country for the government to speak with kidnappers. It happened in Zamfara State when students were kidnapped,’ he said. ‘Government talked to kidnappers in Niger State when students were kidnapped and they were released. ‘Even in Chibok, Borno State some students were released when the government talked to kidnappers. Our own case should not be different. We want the government to talk to the kidnappers so that they can release our people to us. ‘The kidnappers have called us and they said it is the government they want to speak with and not us as parents and relations. ‘We are therefore appealing to the Federal Government to start talking with the kidnappers immediately so that they will not kill the people we are struggling to bring out of the kidnappers’ den,’ the leader of the group said.
