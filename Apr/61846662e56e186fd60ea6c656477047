By Monica Iheakam Cameroon’s Ajara Njoya will have the privilege of deciding Nigeria’s Super Falcons opponents for the TotalEnergies Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, Morocco 2022. Njoya, alongside Morocco’s Olympic gold medalist Nawal El Moutawakel, have been bestowed the honours as assistants for the draws billed for today. Nigeria’s Super Falcons as defending champions are named top seed by the Confederation of African Football, CAF for the event taking place at the Mohamed VI Complex in Rabat, Morocco. Njoya, a FIFA Puskas nominee, has tasted defeat in the hands of Falcons for three editions of the African Women Cup of Nations competitions, where the Nigerian women humbled the Indomitable Lionesses to clinch the trophy. The Inter Milan of Italy striker was part of the Cameroon squad that lost 0-2 to Super Falcons in the finals in 2014 in Namibia. Also in 2016 Njoya’s expectations was dashed with a 0-1 loss to Nigeria who hosted the tournament in Warri, Delta State. Njoya played a prominent role in the 10th meeting between the Super Falcons and Cameroon in the 2018 edition hosted by Ghana, where Nigeria halted their AWCON trophy journey in the semi finals with a lone goal.
