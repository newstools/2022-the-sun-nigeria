From Uche Usim, Abuja Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, has called for the immediate amendment of the Establishment Acts of Federal Government Owned Enterprises (FGOES) to reflect the current economic realities in the country.  In his keynote address  at a Retreat for Chief Executives and Treasury Directors of Revenue of the Federal Government Owned Enterprises (FGOES), held in Abuja, Mustapha explained that such amendment should also reflect government’s current policy thrust in optimising revenues accruing from the FGOEs through remittances of operational surpluses.  “Equally important is the amendment of the establishment Acts of some FGOEs to reflect current economic realities and policy thrust of the government in optimizing the revenues accruing from FGOEs through remittances of operational surpluses”, he said.  The SGF, whose address was read by the Permanent Secretary, General Services office (OSGF), Dr Maurice Nnamdi Mbaeri, noted that there was the need “for strong corporate governance reform, expenditure controls and strengthening the budgetary and financial reporting requirements of the FGOEs”.  In her address, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. (Mrs.) Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, said domestic revenue mobilization is strategically pivotal to sustainably finance Nigeria’s development needs.
