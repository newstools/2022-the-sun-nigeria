Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick has been appointed coach of Austria’s national team, the federation said Friday, but he will continue in a consultancy role at the club. Rangnick joined United as interim manager in November last year and will move into an advisory position after Ajax Coach Erik ten Hag comes in as the new permanent manager. The 63-year-old German “will combine the job with his consultancy role at Old Trafford as planned,” United said in a statement.The Austrian federation said Rangnick had been given a two-year deal that will be extended to four years if he secures qualification for the 2024 European championship. “We are very pleased that in Ralf Rangnick we have been able to attract an outstanding expert in international football,” Austrian federation president Gerhard Milletich said. United’s already slim hopes of finishing in the top four of the Premier League and securing a Champions League spot took another blow with a 1-1 draw against Chelsea on Thursday.
