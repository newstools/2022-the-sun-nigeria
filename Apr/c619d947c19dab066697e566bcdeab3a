Babagana Zulum of Borno has urged presidential aspirants for the 2023 election to always consider the unity and peace of Nigeria as the paramount in their aspirations. Zulum made the call on Monday in Maiduguri when he received the presidential aspirant of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Gov. Nyesome Wike of Rivers State who paid him a courtesy call.
