From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Former Anambra State governor and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Mr. Peter Obi, has lamented the deplorable condition of the economy and high level of insecurity. Obi, who stated this at the headquarters of PDP in Umuahia, Abia State, yesterday, promised to make Nigeria great again under four years if given the opportunity.  He was in Abia to seek the support of delegates in the party’s presidential primary. Obi, who enumerated  his plans for Nigeria to the delegates, said he was in the race to reset Nigeria and uplift its citizens from poverty and deprivations. He promised that in just four years (his first term), Nigeria would achieve an enviable height in all fields. He said his vision was to make Nigeria a producer nation and not a consumer of products. Obi, who frowned at the gross mismanagement of public resources by various administrations, promised to end the culture of money sharing, explaining that the wealth of the people would be deployed to work for the people. He identified hunger and unemployment as the breeding grounds for criminality, adding that Nigeria’s export would increase under his leadership. He acknowledged that the only hurdle before him was the PDP presidential primary,  after which he would defeat candidates of other political parties. He appealed for the support of Abia State delegates and those from other states on the day of the primary. He recalled his achievements as Anambra governor which he said made the state one of the fastest  growing  economy in Africa and promised to replicate the same performance in Nigeria if he gets into Aso Rock.  Chairman of PDP in Abia, Asiforo Okere described Obi as a fine material in whom  “Abia, Igboland and Nigeria are proud of.” He told Obi that Abia PDP delegates would take the right decision on the day of the primary polls.
