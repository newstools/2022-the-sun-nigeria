By Chukwudi Nweje The Indomitable Tinubu Support Organisation (ITSO), a national political network championing the actualisation of the presidential ambition of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said the endorse given to Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu by the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC) would ensure political stability and rapid development. The apex political decision making body in the state had endorsed  Sanwo-Olu for a second term “for staying true to the developmental agenda of Lagos.” It said the endorsement “is a brilliant testimony of his quality stewardship and truly well deserved” ITSO Director-General,  Abdoulbaq Ladi Balogun in a statement, yesterday, noted that all the development projects being executed by Gov. Sanwo-Olu, which won him the hearts of the GAC are the brainchild of Tinubu.  “The Lagos developmental master plan guiding the Sanwo-Olu’s administration was designed by the administration of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to ensure a sustainable smart city, ranking with the best cities of the world;  these sterling achievements recorded by staying true to this masterplan is a testimony to Asiwaju Tinubu’s vision to discover, empower and support brilliant minds, earning him the honour of being referred to as “builders of people.” He assured that Sanwo-Olu will complete all outstanding projects and deliver more dividends of democracy, if reelected in 2023. ITSO urged the electorate to register to vote and continue to support the aspiration of Asiwaju Tinubu to be the next President of Nigeria, noting that the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is the man Nigeria needs at this critical moment to solve all political, economic and security challenges facing the nation.
