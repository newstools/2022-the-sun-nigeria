He thanked the organisers and those who nominated him for the award saying “I won’t let all those who made sure I received this award down. They have found me worthy and I think the best thing to do is to continue doing the good work they know me for. “ I will also continue building the bridge between tribes and ethnic groups because as Nigerians, we need to live together and position the country to be top in the comity of nations.
