We achieve all of this with our strategic partnership with international vendors like EC-Council, PMI, ISAACA, Oracle.” Eralier on, the Director of Baptist Mission Schools, Dr. Tide Olalere, said “We are poised to ensure our children are not left behind in the 21st century ICT education.” He disclosed that qualified schools were judged based on App prototype, Presentation slide, Business plan words for the code/robot description, Creativity, Design, Potential Usefulness, Technical Skill, and Presentation. Winners were awarded cash prizes at every stage of the competition and a certificate of participation.
