He advised the participants to pay much attention on the rudiments of starting a business especially “in carrying out market surveys to know your competitors and write a bankable feasibility studies report.”   The DG while declaring the one-week training open charged the participants to take their training serious, pointing out that even if they failed to get loan, they could at least start up their own businesses with the knowledge acquired from the training.
