From Noah Ebije, Kaduna House of Representatives aspirant for Zangon-Kataf/Jabba federal constituency of Kaduna State for the 2023 general elections Mr Gideon Jock has said that if elected he will partner with Southern Kaduna People’s Union (SOKAPU) to rescue the region from terrorist attacks and ensure even development. Southern Kaduna has been under banditry and terrorism attacks in recent past few years and to date. The people under the umbrella of SOKAPU had been calling on the state and federal governments, including the national and international communities to come to their aid. Several communities had been displaced and many lives were lost to terrorism in the area, which covers about nine local government areas of the State that has a total of 23 council areas. Mr Jock, speaking to reporters at the sideline of a press conference by SOKAPU, recalled how the communities took care of his education, ‘using church money to train me and by extension the community’s money, and so it is time for me to pay back to the community. ‘I will not fail to collaborate with SOKAPU. If I get there I will work hand-in-hand with the union to liberate Southern Kaduna from insecurity and give it the kind of development it desires. ‘I was groomed by the current President of SOKAPU, Honourable Jonathan Asake, former House of Representatives member, the same constituency which I am aspiring to contest now. His kind of person is very few in society. He is selfless and committed to humanitarian services. I appreciate his leadership of SOKAPU for standing for the people.’
