Hence, the need, drive and passion to write this book as my own contribution to the revival of reading culture among the youth and general public. “After the book was published, we took the initiative to approach Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC) in Abuja, and we followed the due process on how to get the book approved.
