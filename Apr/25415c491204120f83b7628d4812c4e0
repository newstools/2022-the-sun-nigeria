Shareholders of  Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals Plc have approved the  plan of the board to raise the sum of N5 billion through a hybrid offer of rights to existing shareholders and  private placement. The money will be used to finance major long term expansion projects. The company will raise N3.67 billion through Rights Issue and N1.32 billion through private placement.   The  sum of N3,679,618,625 will be raised by way of  a Rights Issue at the discounted cost of N1.55 per 50 Kobo share.  The company’s shares  traded above N1.70 Kobo for most of the month of March, 2022. To achieve this the shareholders  approved the creation of  2,373,947,500 additional ordinary shares which will be allotted at the rate of five new shares for every  four shares currently held in the company. The shareholders also approved  that  the company should raise equity capital of N1,320,381,375.60 by way of a private placement at the  premium price of N2.10 Kobo   for 628,753,036 Ordinary Shares. The shareholders gave the approvals  at the 63rd Annual General Meeting of the company held in Lagos recently.  Dr. Ambrosie Orjiako, Chairman of the Board, said the money is being raised for three key reasons.
