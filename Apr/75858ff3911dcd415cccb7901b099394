We have made it clear to the public severally that IPOB members are not unknown gunmen and we cannot be because we have objective which is to restore Biafra as a free, independent and sovereign nation. “Anybody who is involved in this evil act on INEC officers at Ihite Uboma LGA will pay dearly.  The masterminds are being sponsored by unfortunate politicians thinking they can jeopardise our decision to make Biafra freedom a reality,” Powerful explained.
