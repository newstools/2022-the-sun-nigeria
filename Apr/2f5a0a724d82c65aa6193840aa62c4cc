The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, explained that, “the woman said that on getting to the church, they met some other women who came to sweep the church in preparation for Sunday’s service. But as soon as those women left after sweeping the church, the suspect took advantage of being alone with the victim and forcefully had unlawful carnal knowledge of her right inside the church. “Upon the report, DPO Lafenwa division, CSP Kayode Shadrach, detailed detectives to go after the suspect and bring him to justice.
