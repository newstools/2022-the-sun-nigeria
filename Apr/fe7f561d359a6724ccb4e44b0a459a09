From Godwin Tsa, Abuja The Abuja division of the Federal High Court has ordered the final forfeiture of the sum of N9.3 million traced to a former Surveyor-General of the Federation (SGF), Ebisintei Bietoru Awudu, to the coffers of the Federal Government. The order was a sequel to an application brought by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission(ICPC), describing the money as suspected proceeds of crime. Justice Evelyn Maha made the order in line with the provision of section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act, No14, 2006. The judge held that the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission(ICPC), proved beyond reasonable doubt that the property and the money were proceeds of crime as defined by the Money Laundering Prohibition Act of 2011. She noted that, in the absence of any objection to the notice of interim forfeiture which had been published for interested parties to show cause why the assets should not be finally forfeited, the court ordered the final forfeiture of the properties to the federal government. Justice Maha had on December 9, 2021, granted an exparte motion by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) for an interim order forfeiting the properties to the Federal government. The said exparte motion marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1464/2021, was brought pursuant to section 44(2)(b)and (k) of the 1999 constitution; section 17 of the Advanced Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006, section 48 of the ICPC Act 2000. Listed as respondents in the motion exparte dated November 23, 2021, are Surveyor Ebisintei Bietoru Awudu, Kumeni Services Limited and Geolev Nigeria Limited. She thereafter ordered the applicant to publish the notice of the order in two national dailies not later than December 30, 2021, with a directive that the properties will be liable to a final forfeiture order to the Federal Government, where and if no one comes forward to show cause why an order of final forfeiture should not be granted by the court. ‘That any person, body or entity who is interested in the properties, are at liberty to formally file his/her or its objection to the court, within 14 days from the date of publication and must also inform the legal representative to the applicant, the substance of it in advance,’ the judge ruled. The case was thereafter adjourned to January 19, 2022, for hearing. The ICPC told the court how the former Surveyor-General of the Federation, Awudu acquired the sum of N95.3 million through corrupt and fraudulent activities, including the award of phoney contracts and demanding and receiving gratification in the performance of his official duties.
