The first semi final takes place at the Red Bull Arena, where RB Leipzig welcomes Scottish giants, Rangers, showing on SuperSport Football (DStv channel 205). The German hosts took down Atalanta 3-1 on aggregate in the quarterfinals, while the Scottish visitors had a thrilling 3-2 overall triumph over Sporting Braga. “We’re working hard and want to try and win the trophy,” said Leipzig attacker Christopher Nkunku, who will be a key danger man in this tie.  ‘Gers boss Giovanni van Bronckhorst is backing his side’s mentality now that they are just 180 minutes away from a first continental final since the 2008 UEFA Cup they lost to Russian side, Zenit St. Petersburg. “It starts with the belief that you can go through. I’m really happy that we could give the fans a game they were proud of and proceeding in Europe is huge,” said the Dutch tactician.
