The Group Executive Chairman, Mr Tony Elumelu, who made the disclosure at its 16th Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Abuja, attributed the positive performance to a diversified investment portfolio, especially in Afam Power Limited and Transcorp Power Limited that accounted for 81 per cent of the gross revenue.
