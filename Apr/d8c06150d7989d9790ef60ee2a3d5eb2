Godwin Obaseki of Edo has urged the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps to avoid unhealthy inter-agency rivalry and  collaborate with local communities across the state to provide measures against threat and any form of criminality. Obaseki made the call when the new Edo NSCDC Commandant, Mr Samuel Dan, paid him  a visit at the Edo Government House in Benin on Wednesday. He emphasised the need for synergy among all security agencies. ”We know that your men on ground are limited in number and one of the things that leads to success is collaboration and being able to work with locals. ”These locals are people who understand the  terrain,  you have to lean on them and rely on them for quality intelligence. “There must be mutual respect for the people you have come to meet and sister security agencies. “That trust must be quickly built. Any sense of interagency rivalry will not help. We enjoy good working relationships with the police, Department of State Services (DSS) and your organisation and we will like that to continue,’” Obaseki said. The governor reminded the NSCDC boss that his first responsibility was to the Edo people. Earlier, Dan, said the NSCDC would cooperate and relate with other security agencies and stakeholders in the state to achieve the desired result. “Without such collaboration, we may not succeed, knowing fully well that cooperation begins with meaningful partnership with the government and other stakeholders. “We shall continue to collaborate with stakeholders to ensure effective protection of lives and properties in the state. ” We shall make efforts to protect individuals, organizations, businesses, groups and communities against any form of threat”, he said.
