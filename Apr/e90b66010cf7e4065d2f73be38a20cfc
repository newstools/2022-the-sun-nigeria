The suspects who were arrested in various parts of the city at midnight according to the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the operation, Ben Igwe, would be deported to their states of origin after investigations.

He said the police would continue to carry out regular raids on known criminal hideouts until all criminals are wiped out from the city. ‘Abuja is not for everybody. We are working towards clearing them from the FCT. We will keep doing that and we will not relent,’ Igwe stated. ‘We recovered from them several things that they are not supposed to scavenge. They steal properties while claiming to scavenge refuses. ‘We have asked them to relocate. Many people have been trooping into the FCT. And some of them are coming with evil intentions. Whenever you see them, let us know. ‘We are taking them to court to make sure that justice is given. We have a serious issue now because of threats from so many places.’
