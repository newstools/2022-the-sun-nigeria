From Abdulrazaq Mungadi, Gombe Gombe State Governor Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya has assured that his ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state is rock solid in terms of strength and has the performance to show for it. The governor stated this while speaking at the distribution of empowerment items on Sunday in Gombe. He noted that citizens always appreciate the leadership that cultivates the habit of doing things that directly impact their lives. He said ‘this is the main thrust of the APC administration in Gombe.’ He assured that his administration will continue to accord priority to policies and programs that have a direct bearing on the life of the common man. However, he urged other elected officials and political appointees in the state to also strive in impacting the lives of the electorate.
