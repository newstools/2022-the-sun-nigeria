The decline of 84per cent and 85 per cent respectively in the PBT and PAT is largely driven by higher claims experienced in our health portfolio coupled with fair value losses and foreign exchange losses.  The core underlying earnings (excluding fair value gains/losses, capital gains/losses and foreign exchange movements) dipped by 22 per cent mainly driven by the higher claims experienced in our Health portfolio.  “Across all lines of businesses we continue to build necessary actuarial reserves to ensure we have a strong balance sheet,”  Ola-Israel, looking forward affirmed that the company remain optimistic of the value creation possibilities that exist within its business areas and with the continued support of shareholders, customers, and the dedication of staff and other key stakeholders, saying, “We will deliver excellent underwriting, investment, and operating performance as we prioritize providing value to our valued customers.”  Similarly, the Chief Executive Officer, of the Assets Management firm, Kunle Ahmed, asserted that AXA begun the fiscal year 2022 on a solid footing, although it recorded a temporary setback on PBT despite growing revenue by double digit, noting that such experience reflects the macroeconomic uncertainties that have continued to plague global business environment.
