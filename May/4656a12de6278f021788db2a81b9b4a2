Today, we have taken another step in the journey to restore hope by submitting Governor Yahaya Bello’s form. “With this form, we express our sincere assurance that with Yahaya Bello’s candidacy, we have the opportunity to restore to the Nigerian people security, we have the opportunity to restore to the Nigerian people, unity and progress towards prosperity. “We welcome every aspirant to the race and we want to encourage all Nigerians to keep faith. Governor Yahaya Bello did not start this effort this month, he did not start it this year, he started it many years ago. He has canvassed the whole country and he has signaled to the Nigerian people his capacity of competence. “He has built his credibility within the party, and he has built allies along religion, across every divide, so we have nothing to fear from other aspirants, especially those who are just applying now. We see that some aspirants are going around meeting people but we have been doing that for years. We are fully confident by the movement that he represents. “As you see, I am not here by myself, I am with many members of our team as well as supporters, and we are so proud to give Nigerians something great. We have no reservations about his competence. From his first day in office, he started working to unify, to bring security to the state and to restore sanity to the civil service system. This is what he will do as President and we look forward to Nigerian people welcoming him as a candidate come June 1, 2022,” she said.
