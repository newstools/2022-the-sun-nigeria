By Omodele Adigun About 200 participants are expected at the 6th Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises’ (MSMEs) Trade Fair organised by the Nigerian Association of Small Scale Industrialists (NASSI), Lagos Chapter, in conjunction with the Lagos State government. According to its Chairman,  Local Organising  Committee (LOC), Mr Peter Popoola, the week-long  event, which holds at the Digital Bridge Institute, Oshodi, will commence on Monday, May 9  and end  on  Friday, May 13, 2022, with the theme: The Indispensable Role of MSMEs in Quest for Nigeria’s Industrialisation. “The trade fair is to expose our members’ products to the market. You all know that sale is the blood of every business. No matter how good your product is, if your product is not selling, the business will go into non- existence,” Popoola stated while drumming support for the exhibition, as he lamented NASSI members are battling myriads of challenges such as poor patronage , lack of constant power supply and funding inaccessibility. He noted that small scale industries were the backbone of an economy, especially Nigeria, where they are over 80 per cent contribute significantly  to GDP as well as providing jobs. NASSI Lagos Chairman Mrs. Getrude Aikhimien, said the government, as the biggest spender, should assist the members by buying their goods. She, however, thanked the Lagos State government for its assistance over the years and for sponsoring the fair.
