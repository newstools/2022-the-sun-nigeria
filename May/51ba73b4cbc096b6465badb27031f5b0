The FIRS, in a statement signed by the Executive Chairman, Muhammad Nami, appreciated the country’s taxpayers, noting that without them the Service would not have been able to achieve the feat it recorded in 2021 where it surpassed its tax collection target for the year and crossed the N6trillion threshold for the first time.
