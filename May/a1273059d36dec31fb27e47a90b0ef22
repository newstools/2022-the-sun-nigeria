From Desmond Mgboh, Kano A former Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on National Assembly Matters, Abdulrahman Sulaiman Kawu, has implored the former Governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau, to dump the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Kawu made the appeal in a statement he signed at the weekend, explaining the reason behind his exit from the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to him, the All Progressives Congress(APC)has crossed the point of no -return and nothing it would do in future would return it to its lost glory. He explained that he and a former Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Kabiru Alhassan Rirum, were at the residence of Shekarau to encourage him not to listen to Ganduje’s appeal to stay in the party. “If Ganduje were serious about wanting Shekarau to remain in the party, why did he ask AA Zaura and Bashir Lado to purchase Kano Central Senatorial forms, despite the agreement he had with Shekarau?,’ he asked. Meanwhile, a cloud of uncertainty is still hovering over Shekarau’s next plan as both sides of the political divides in the state sustain their efforts to lure him over. Sources close to Daily Sun indicated that as part of the peace deal with the APC, Shekarau was, on Friday night, offered his senatorial seat, about three House of Reps seats and five State Assembly seats by Governor Ganduje. Sources also told Daily Sun that a former Governor of Lagos State and the leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has also intervened, with the likely outcome that Shekarau may no longer defect. Tinubu was slated to arrive in Kano on Sunday but had shifted his visit to Thursday to give room for the progress in the feud before embarking on the trip.
