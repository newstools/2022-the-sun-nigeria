Following frequent vandalism of electricity installations across the country,  Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), has threatened  its workers with life imprisonment and dismissal  if they are  involved in the destruction of the company’s assets. Making reference to the AEDC staff who was convicted and jailed in Kogi State  for his involvement in a vandalism case, the AEDC  Marketing Manager, Mr Donald Etim, warned that the company has zero tolerance for vandalism of its network assets irrespective of whether perpetrators of such actions are staff of AEDC or members of the general public.  He explained that disciplinary measures would take its full course which, in this case, is outright dismissal and loss of all employee benefits.  He added that vandalism of electricity network infrastructure is a serious offence punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment under Section 1(9) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act LFN 2004.  In a statement, Etim recalled that  an Upper Sharia Court sitting in Minna, Niger State, handed a one-year jail term to one Abdulsalamad Abubakar, who was caught vandalising an AEDC substation in Paida junction of Minna.
