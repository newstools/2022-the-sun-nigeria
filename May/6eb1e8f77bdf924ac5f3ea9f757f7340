By Chinwendu Obienyi Despite the rout across the global equities market, the rally in the Nigerian equities market remained unscathed as intense bargain hunting activities in stocks pushed the All-Share Index (ASI) higher by 4.25 per cent week-on-week (w/w) to close at 53,100.21 points.

Elsewhere, risk-off sentiments reverberated across global markets as investors assessed the risk of a slowing global economy against the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening moves. Accordingly, US (DJIA: -3.6 per cent; S&P 500: -4.7 per cent) stocks posted huge losses as investors reacted negatively to Federal Reserve officials comments on further tightening of monetary policy while European markets (STOXX Europe: -0.4 per cent; and FTSE 100: -0.9 per cent) were set for a weekly loss as global growth and inflation concerns remained elevated in the region. Also, Asian markets posted mixed performances, as the Japanese Nikkei 225: (-2.1 per cent) closed lower mirroring selloffs on Wall Street.  Elsewhere, the SSE: (+2.8 per cent) reversed weeks of losses as authorities ruled out the imposition of a lockdown in Beijing amid measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Emerging (MSCI EM: -4.2 per cent) and Frontier (MSCI FM: -5.0 per cent) market stocks mirrored the bearish trend across global stocks consequent upon losses in South Korea (-1.5 per cent) and Kuwait (-7.3 per cent), respectively. Reacting to the performance of Nigeria’s stock market, analysts at Cordros Research, said that there is likely to be some profit taking while adding that “cautious trading” is likely to dominate transactions on the trading floor of NGX this week. “In the near term, we think the bears are likely to book profit across most counters, given the five-week bullish run in the market.  Thus, we see more of a “choppy theme” as cautious trading takes center stage ahead of the MPC meeting scheduled later in the month. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings”, they said.
