The United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc celebrated this year’s Africa Day in commemoration of African unity with the fourth edition of its annual UBA Africa Conversations which was held Tuesday in Lagos.  The UBA Africa Conversations  was established in May 2019 as a hallmark initiative in a series of celebrations for Africa Day. The conversations provide a platform for African and global audiences to connect with global thought leaders both in the private and public sectors, on their African journey, in a quest to change the narrative on Africa from desolate to successful. This year’s conversation was themed ‘The importance of reflecting our African culture in global success stories’ and underscores the tremendous shift in Africa’s cultural influence  – from Afrobeat to African films; Big African fashion labels and African authors; entertainment and culture. The African continent is creating positive impact globally. UBA’s Deputy Managing Director, Oliver Alawuba, who welcomed the panellists and the guests to the event stated that, as Africa’s global bank, UBA remains at the forefront of supporting businesses across the continent.
