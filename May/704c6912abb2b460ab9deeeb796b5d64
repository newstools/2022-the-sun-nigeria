The Adamawa Central Senator had weeks ago debunked rumours that she had stepped down. The lawmaker made the clarification while addressing delegates and stakeholders of the party separately in Ganye, Jada, Toungo and Mayo-Belwa local governments when she visited the areas within the week. Following the development, Senator Aishatu Binani is set to slug it out with the incumbent Governor of the state Ahmadu Fintiri who also recently emerged as the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) governorship candidate to contest the 2023 election for a second term of office. If she eventually defeats the Governor in the general gubernatorial polls, Senator Aishatu “Gimbiyar Adamawa” as she is popularly called will become the first elected female Governor in the History of the country.
