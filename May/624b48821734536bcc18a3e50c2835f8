Speaking during the dinner, Kalu, a former governor of Abia State, expressed delight in having the United States team in his residence. Kalu said: “Thank you for coming this evening. This is what we have to do more often. “Our country is going through transition and it is always good from time to time to eat with diplomats of all cadres – from the highest to the lowest and from the lowest to the highest, to impart them informally or formally about what is happening in our country. “It is always the pleasure of myself and my wife to sit down and entertain people to be able to continue and expand our friendship.” On her part, FitzGibbon thanked Kalu for receiving her and other officials from the Embassy. “Thank you for having us. It is a good opportunity for my team to actually get to meet somebody who is in a position of influence and to be able to understand better, what is really going on behind the scenes,” FitzGibbon said.
