He devoted most of his times to developing a unique brand of music called ‘Symphony Juju’, which is loved by his fans across the country. “Symphony Juju is my brand of music. It is a fusion of all genres of music like Afro-pop, Afro highlife, classics and core juju music. This is just the beginning, my best is yet to come,” he said. Baba Tee added that lyrical quality, content and natural artistic talent are   paramount to his musical career, which according to him, was evident in his recent album.
