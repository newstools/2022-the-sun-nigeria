The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for the state police command, Mrs Funmilayo Odunlami confirmed the development. She said the two victims were freed at the same time and they have since reunited with their family members. The victims were travelling along the road when the hoodlums accosted and dragged them into the bush to an unknown destination where they were held hostage for days. The kidnappers had demanded a sum of N10 million as a ransom for the release of the two victims.

It was not certain whether or not any ransom was paid before the victims were released.
