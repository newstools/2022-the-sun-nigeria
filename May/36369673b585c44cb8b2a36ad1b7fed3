Fred Ezeh, Abuja The advisory arm (Ime-Obi) of the Ohaneze Ndigbo, in Abuja, has thrown its support to the proposed summit on restructuring being organised by the body. The Igbo leaders took the decision at the end of their meeting, in Abuja, at the weekend. President of the FCT chapter of the socio-cultural organization, Odozi Nwodozi, said in a statement that the restructuring has become imperative to give opportunity to all sections of the country to participate in the socio-economic and political leadership of Nigeria. He said, “The current state of Nigerian governance structure would continue to promote bickering, hatred and bitterness among Nigerians. It is unfortunate that some people have become perpetual slave to others and that could be attributed to the governance system of Nigeria. “We must restructure Nigerian state in a way that will allow for the maximization of the potentials of Ndigbo in the Nigerian project.” The FCT Igbo leaders also condemned the recent bombing of the country home of the President General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Chief John Nnia Nwodo. They charged security agencies to rise to the occasion, to fish out the culprits and ensure that such alien acts does not repeat itself in Igboland.
