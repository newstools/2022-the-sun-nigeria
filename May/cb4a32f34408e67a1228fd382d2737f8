He said “for equity sake,it must move to Okigwe North having been in the south for some time, since 2011,Okigwe left the government house the north has not occupied a leading position and we need to have rallying point, Mbakwe, Echeruo is dead ,we need somebody that will coordinate us. “Having critically looked at it, Ikedi Ohakim is the best candidate, so we started contributing money to buy this form for him. Our choice of Ohakim is also based on his synergy with governor Hope Uzodimma, so we felt the governor will make lesser travel to Abuja for with experienced hand like Ohakim as a senator.
