OCP Africa, the global fertilizer giant, said it is collaborating with the government in the plan to   modernise agriculture sector by  enhancing the competitiveness of agro entrepreneurs  and diversifying the economy.  Its Country Manager, Caleb Usoh, reiterated the commitment of the company to  contribute to the goals to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. To this end, OCP Africa is partnering Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture (SFSA) to   groom   growers and agro entrepreneurs to deploy greenhouse technologies to  boost food security,exports  and economic growth. With  the growing population  resulting  in a demand for higher quality products, food safety, stable supply and more up-scaled and sustainable production, Usoh  noted that to  address these challenges, institutions should join forces to develop a modern greenhouse vegetable production sector. He said OCP Africa was working to transfer  skills and knowhow of   controlled environment agriculture   that can provide optimum efficiency and higher nutrient density  and increase domestic crop production. He explained that its partnership with SFSA was a collaboration to advance shared goals of  sustainable and secure food production. He explained that there were  numerous areas where sector development and smallholder support were  needed, as the challenges faced by  farmers present themselves in various activities along the value chains.
