For talented singer,  Uyinmwen Omosigho, aka Don VS, persistence and resilience are the traits needed to thrive in showbusiness, especially in Nigeria.   In a recent interview, the Edo State born Single Mother Crooner said: “Never give up in life, pursue your dreams no matter the situation and environment. Your resilience and persistence will take you to the top, not just your talent. Keep pushing, you will achieve your dreams, if you don’t give up. Resilience and persistence are the traits needed to succeed as an entertainer irrespective of the level of talent or giftedness”.      On how his musical sojourn began, Don VS said the journey started in 2004 in far away in Benin City, the Edo state capital.   “I started my music career back then in Nigeria in 2004, Benin City was my starting point. I was on a TV show called Beat and Laugh at EBS, Edo Broadcasting Service.”   One of the ways to rise swiftly in the music industry is collaborations with a much more established artiste.   When Don VS was asked  who he would love to collaborate with he said: “Who knows what a collaboration with the likes of Burna Boy, Wizkid and Davido will do to Don V’s career in the few years ahead? I will love to collaborate these artistes”.     Don VS also averred that he is open to working with different kind of artistes, adding that it is the musical connection that matters.   “I don’t have a specific artiste to work with but I will work with any of the artistes depending on the song. So all artistes are good and I will work with as many I can work with when the time comes. What matters is the vibe and musical connection”.
