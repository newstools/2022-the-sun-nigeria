BY PHILIP NWOSU The National Leader of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) Chief Edwin Clark has criticised the sidelining and the continued marginalisation of members of the Igbo nation in the leadership of Nigeria, insisting that if the Igbo are now allowed to rule in 2023, there will be no Nigeria. Chief Clark who spoke on Arise TV programme, The Morning Show, lamented that the unity of Nigeria is being toyed with, especially if the people of Igbo nation are being left out in the political future of Nigeria. He also lamented the fact that Boko Haram insurgents who took arms against the country are captured and retrained and reintegrated into the main stream of Nigerian politics, adding that it amount to great injustice if after the civil war the Igbos have not been allowed to rule Nigeria. He said: “Any Southern Governor, any southern former governor who agrees to be a Vice to a northerner in this election is not a true northerner and God will deal with him.” Clark said several negotiations have been entered into by Alhaji Ango Abdullahi  the leader of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), but each time the issue of restructuring is mention, he will back out., a”adding nobody will take us for a ride, Nigeria belong to all of us, what will the Igbo man tell his son that after the war they cannot become president.”
