It’s uncalled-for seeing these senior citizens protesting across different states against negligence of state governors over their plights.”  He urged Sanwo-Olu to keep on with the training and retraining of union leaders and others and urge him to do more because the importance of training in promoting industrial peace and harmony are enormous.
