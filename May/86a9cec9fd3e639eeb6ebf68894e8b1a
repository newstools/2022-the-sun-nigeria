Evening dresses have a way of making ones skin glow and eyes pop during an event. A lot of attractive strapless, backless and halter dresses appeared on the red carpet at the event. They were simple, yet alluring. Jumpsuit will never go out of fashion. They appeared in all shapes and sizes, fitted to various body types. Some came in long sleeves, halter tops, deep v-necks, and more. African prints such as ankara, batik, have become mainstay in fashion, not just as a form of the traditional style, but as part of new global fashion culture. A lot of them came on the red carpet at The Sun Awards in many gorgeous styles. A white dress is one of the wardrobe staples for every woman. White dresses are gorgeous. Any colour goes with white. And as it was, some glamorous women came  in white dresses, made in various styles. Accessories such as shoes and jewellery can make or mar an outfit.
