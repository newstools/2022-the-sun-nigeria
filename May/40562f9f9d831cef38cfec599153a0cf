Former Senate president,  Anyim Pius Anyim, has urged the faithful to continue to make sacrifices in prayers and fasting for the peace, unity and progress of Nigeria, even as they enjoy the festivities that come with the celebration. The sacrifice, Anyim said, is most needed now that the country is going through difficult times in combating worsening economic downturn, insecurity and other threats to the comfort and wellbeing of the citizens and our country.
