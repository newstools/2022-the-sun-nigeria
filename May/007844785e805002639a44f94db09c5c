Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund(IMF) has predicted that the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), also known as e-Naira,  may function as a deposit at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and consequently reduce demand for deposits in the commercial banks. In its report, entitled ‘Country Focus; Five Observations on Nigeria’s Central Bank Digital Currency, the Brentwood institution noted that the “eNaira wallets may be perceived, or even effectively function, as a deposit at the central bank, which may reduce demand for deposits in commercial banks. Relying as it does on digital technology, there is a need to manage cyber security and operational risks associated with the it”. In  a related development, addressing a delegation of Executive Directors from the Bank of Uganda, who was on an experience sharing tour of the CBDC project recently, the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele promised that the apex bank would achieve the 85 per cent financial inclusion rate target, in a very short period from its current rate of slightly below 70 per cent.
