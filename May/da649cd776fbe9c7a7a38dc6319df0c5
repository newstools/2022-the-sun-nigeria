From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja  INEC has told the 18 political parties to adhere to the timeline for the conduct of their primaries for the 2023 general elections, stating that the deadline is firm and fixed. In a statement by its National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye, in Abuja, yesterday, INEC recalled that the Commission, on February 26, released the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 General Elections which provided for parties to conduct their primaries for the nomination of candidates from April 4 to June 3.

The programmes are for the purpose of nominating candidates for various elective offices as specified in the constitution and the Electoral Act.

He said nominations for Presidential and National Assembly elections shall be submitted through the INEC web portal from June 10 to June 17 while governorship and state Houses of Assembly nominations shall be submitted between July 1 and 15. “Political parties are further reminded that they must submit to the commission the list of candidates who must have emerged from valid primaries. “The commission will continue to work with political parties to ensure fidelity to the constitution, the Electoral Act, and the timelines for all the activities contained in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election,” Okoye said.
