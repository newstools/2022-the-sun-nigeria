Edoho, who studied Animal Science at the University of Calabar, was a rap artiste with the stage name MC Frank while in school. His broadcasting career started at the Cross River State Broadcasting Corporation, where he worked as a presenter. At the same time, he also anchored a breakfast programme for the Nigerian Television Authority, Channel 9, Calabar. The suave presenter moved to Metro FM 97.6 thereafter and anchored radio shows.  He came to national and international limelight when he hosted the popular television game show, “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.” Teni attended Apata Memorial High School, Lagos and American Intercontinental University, where she obtained a degree in Business Administration. She launched into the music scene with “Amen,” her debut single, through the Shizzi’s Magic Fingers Records, while her debut album, “Wonderland,” featured guest appearances from Davido. The album took two years to make, with work done in London, New York, Orlando, Ondo, Lagos and Abuja. Teni’s album, Fargin, launched her to limelight, but her breakthrough came after the release of her popular singles “Askamaya”, “Case” and “Uyo Meyo.” In 2019, Teni released her debut E.P, “Billionaire,” with six tracks and no guest appearance. In April 2020, she did collaboration with DJ Neptune to release “Quarantine Playlist,” four-track EP. Methodist Bishop and co-chair of Inter-faith Dialogue Forum for Peace, Bishop Sunday Onuoha, will chair The Sun Awards 2021. Bishop Onuoha, who served as Special Assistant on Privatisation in the Presidential Cabinet of President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2003, is founder of Vision Africa International, which empowers Nigerians and other Africans to solve problems and cure society’s ills. He served for six years as the Bishop in-charge of Evangelism, the first in the history of the Methodist Church Nigeria, during which he developed a strategy that enabled the church to plant over 600 new churches across the world. Bishop Onuoha, in 2009, led the Nigerian Inter-Faith Action Association (NIFAA), which is the largest Christian-Muslim collaboration in history. He was personally selected for this role by the Sultan of Sokoto and the Archbishop of the Catholic Church because he carries such a unique position of trust within the wide range of faith communities in Nigeria. Under his leadership NIFAA provided a platform for inter-religious collaboration to curtail malaria in Nigeria, an effort which was cited by former United States President, Barack Obama, as a leading example of cooperative efforts to solve common problems. Bishop Sunday has received the Global Peace Interfaith Leadership Award from the Global Peace Foundation for his efforts in advancing interfaith medical collaboration, humanitarian service and peace through Vision Africa and NIFAA.
