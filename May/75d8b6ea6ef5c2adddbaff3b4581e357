Obuah, who was the immediate past  chairman of the PDP in the state, pledged to live by his philosophy of ‘Go Round’. He said: “You know my name is ‘Go Round’. I want to make sure that at least, I reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, so that the wealth can go round.” He disclosed that the screening exercise was straightforward and very successful, adding “We are expecting nothing but success all the way.  We have all been screened and by the grace of God, it is confirmed.
