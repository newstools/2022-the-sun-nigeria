From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi National Leader of the All Progressives Congress APC Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has vowed that he will not retire from partisan politics until he becomes President of Nigeria. Tinubu who made the vow during his campaign visit to Benue State on Tuesday ahead of the APC’s primaries slated to hold this Friday, said if elected, he would bring his wealth of experience to bear on the governance of the country. “I won’t retire from politics until I am the president of Nigeria. I will bring the experience of my leadership in Lagos state as a Governor to bare on my leadership style in Nigeria. The former Lagos State Governor who insisted that he is the best man for the job said if he emerges as the Presidential candidate of the APC, he will surely win the presidential election no matter whoever emerges as the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party PDP. “There’s no contest between me and whoever will emerge as the candidate of opposition PDP,” he stated. The APC National Leader assured that if and when elected as president of the country, he would run a transparent and open government. “I guarantee you that I will run a transparent, open government. Nigeria is rich. What we need is to redirect our resources and channel them in the right direction,” he said. Earlier in a remark, Sen Kashim Shettima while extolling the virtues of Sen JS Tarka as leader and emancipator of the minority interest groups in Nigeria, insisted that Asiwaju Tinubu is the right person to take Nigeria to the promised land.
