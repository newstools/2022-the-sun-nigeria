Stories from Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu has approved the recruitment of 350 people into the State Security Network, otherwise known as Operation Amotekun. This, the governor noted, would improve the security of life and property of the state. Akeredolu announced this at an award programme organised by the Ondo State Agribusiness Empowerment Centre (OSAEC),  yesterday, in Akure. Governor Akeredolu also disclosed that more operational vehicles and motorcycles would be purchased to aid the corps’ operation in the state. He said it became imperative to recruit more hands into the security outfit because the corps had been overstretched, while protecting farmers in the forest.  The governor, who noted that there was a time agricultural investors were leaving the state until the advent of Amotekun, said, “we have agreed to employ 350 personnel into the Amotekun Corps in the state because of the pressure on the security outfit. “Operational vehicles and motorcycles will also be purchased to ease their work,” he added. He said there would soon be Amotekun stations in rural areas, as those places are not on the road, but in the bush. The governor said although the state had interventions from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), his administration is developing agriculture in all the senatorial districts. Akeredolu said Ondo State unarguably supplies over 45 percent of tomatoes being sold in Lagos markets. He disclosed his commitment to launch Ondo state into the world map of agriculture and assured that he would continue to partner relevant stakeholders to achieve his goal. He said the Okitipupa oil palm plantation, abandoned over the years, has been brought back to limelight, as part of his commitment to the red-gold (palm oil) revolution.
