From Okey Sampson, Umuahia   The former senator representing Abia Central Senatorial District, Dr (Mrs.) Nkechi Nwaogu, has given reasons for her withdrawal from yesterday’s Abia Senatorial All Progressives Congress (APC) primaries. In a letter addressed to the national chairman of APC, Abdullahi Adamu, through her Ward Chairman in Isiala Ngwa South, Abia State Nwaogu stated that she decided to withdraw from the race owing to the undemocratic manner the 3-man delegates primaries in the state was conducted. She said the undemocratic process had given undue advantage to few individuals, at the detriment of majority of the party members who had wanted to contest the primaries. Nwaogu equally stated that the undemocratic process in choosing delegates for the primaries, brewed confusion that led to the party having two gubernatorial candidates from two different Governorship primaries. She noted that while Uche Ogah, former Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, adhered to the guideline provided by the national leadership of the party, and conducted a direct primary, Ikechi Emenike on the other hand, went out of his way and conducted his, based on indirect primaries. The former Senator said it was on the basis of these anomalies and the attendant confusion that she decided to withdraw from the race.
