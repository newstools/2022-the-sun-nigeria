From Okey Sampson, Umuahia A Methodist Church Bishop and President, Vision Africa International, Dr Sunday Onuoha said he has been given the mandate by the people of Abia State to run for governor in 2023.

The Chairman of ADC, Abia State chapter, Don Norman Obinna said the party was going to win the governorship election in 2023 and end bad governance in the state. He vowed to destroy godfatherism in the state which he said was the foundation behind bad governance being experienced in Abia State. Obinna, while stating that ADC will not step down for any other political party’s candidate, stated that ADC is a mass movement that will liberate Abia State from its deplorable state. He lamented that graduates in Abia are now forced to do menial jobs as a result of unemployment, and stressed that time has come for Abians to choose their leaders, instead of imposing anointed candidates on them.
