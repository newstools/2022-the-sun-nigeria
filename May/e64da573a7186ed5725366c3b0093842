From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP), presidential aspirant, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen has withdrawn from the opposition party’s presidential primary scheduled for today. Hayatu-Deen, in a letter to the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, said the contest has been “obscenely” monetized. According to him, he did not join politics for personal gains. He said “I wish to reiterate that I did not join party politics and to contest for the presidency because of personal gains and inordinate ambition, but in order to serve our country. “It is therefore based on personal principles and with great humility that I have decided after wide consultations to withdraw from this contest which has been obscenely monetized. “I wish to thank all my supporters, especially those from my state, well-wishers, friends, family, the extraordinary hardworking young men and women of our campaign organization, the party leadership and members for their tremendous support which enabled us to contribute within this short period towards changing the character and direction of the Nigerian political landscape. “Finally, as a very loyal party member and believer in the democratic process, I will continue to avail myself and my teeming supporters at all times to ensure victory of our great party.”
