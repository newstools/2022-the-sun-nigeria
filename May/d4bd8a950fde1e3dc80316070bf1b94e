Media Adviser to Adeola, Kayode Odunaro, yesterday, in a statement said the Yewa traditional council in a letter dated, September 29, 2021 entitled: “Conferment of the prestigious title of Aremo of Yewaland,” had made it known that the council approved the conferment of the title of Aremo of Yewaland on Adeola over four years ago.

He added that the senator who received the letter, personally signed by Oba Olugbenle, accepted the honour and the installation was fixed as part of the 10th anniversary of the installation of the paramount ruler. “The unprecedented installation which also included a title of Yeye Aremo for the senator’s wife, Temitope, is expected to be witnessed by all Yewa obas as well as other obas in Ogun State and Lagos State.  Other Yewa sons and daughters to be honoured with titles alongside the Aremo-Oba include Akeem Ade Adigun as Apagunpote of Yewaland, Ibrahim Dende Egungbohun as Oluomo of Yewaland and Salmot Badaru, former deputy governor of Ogun State as Beere of Yewaland. “The 10th anniversary celebration of the ascension to the throne of the paramount ruler of Yewaland will also witness the public presentation of the autobiography of Oba Olugbenle, entitled: “Double Grace: Kingship and Service,” under the co-chairmanship of Aliko Dangote and the president of the Senate, with chief launchers as Abdulsamad Rabiu and Kessington Adebutu.”
