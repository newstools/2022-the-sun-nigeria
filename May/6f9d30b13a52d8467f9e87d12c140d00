From Fred Ezeh, Abuja Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) will start today and run till May 14. Information from the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) indicated that the examination would  be conducted for 1.7 million successful registered candidates in 755 registered and accredited computer base test nationwide. JAMB spokesman, Fabian Benjamin, told Daily Sun that all was set for the start of the examination and that the board has put in all measures to ensure smooth conduct of the exercise. Fabian had, in a statement earlier in the week, advised candidates who registered for the exercise to print their 2022 UTME notification slip which contains information on location of candidate’s examination centre, date of scheduled sessions, time of the examination and other necessary information. He reiterated that all candidates would be checked into the examination hall using the biometric verification machine which is also a register of attendance in line with the board’s policy of “no biometric verification, no examination.” He reminded candidates that the ban on prohibited items is still in force, thus asking candidates to be careful not to run foul of the law as necessary sanctions would be meted out to violators of its code of conduct. He listed the banned items within the examination hall to include but not limited to flash drives, smart watches, calculators, recorders, mobile phones, spy reading glasses, among others.
