Oluseye Ojo, IBADAN Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday asked Nigerians for greater understanding and patience in the face of the tough economic circumstances in the country. President Muhammadu Buhari, he said, was aware of the economic hardship facing the people and understands “the pain that you feel. He has asked me to reassure you that a glorious dawn awaits.” Osinbajo disclosed this in his goodwill message at the South West Conference of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held at the Premier Hotel, Ibadan yesterday. “We seek your continued trust and ask you all to join hands with the government as we tackle and surmount the challenges ahead. Change is not easy, but we are not relenting until we achieve a better life for all Nigerians. The change that we advocate will be irrevocable when we are finally done,” he said. Osinbajo, who was represented by Senator Babafemi Ojudu, admitted that  just a little over a year ago the present administration came to power majority of Nigerians are already fed up with the situation of things in the country; and the direction that the seemingly rudderless ship of the Nigerian state was headed. He continued: “Nigerians who desired the needed change that we promised voted for our great party in their millions. That confidence reposed in us by millions of Nigerians is what we have come to renew. “Since we have savoured the sweetness of that electoral victory, we cannot afford to betray the trust that paved the way to usher in change from the ineptness of the past. When we took over the reins of governance, we knew things were bad. What we did not realise, however, was just how bad they really were. Now we know better!”
