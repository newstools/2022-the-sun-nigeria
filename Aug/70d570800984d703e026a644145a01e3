We went round all AHF centres in Benue and picked out young people. We are starting off with 35 of them in Benue who were picked from our centres across the state. “We are trying to put leadership in the hands of young people. Today is the formal inauguration for Benue chapter. So far, we only have Benue and Abuja chapters. Other chapters will soon open in other states of the federation,” he said.
