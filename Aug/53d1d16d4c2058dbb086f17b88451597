A man of Asia origin fired multiple gunshots outside the Consulate General of China in Los Angeles Tuesday morning before shooting himself dead, local police said. The shooting, reported about 6:00 a.m.(1300 GMT), did not injure anyone else. The man, in his 60s, was found dead in his vehicle parked 20 meters away from the consulate office building, according to a statement read by a local police officer to Xinhua. Policemen confirmed that the man was of Asia origin, but did not identify him. They found a bullet wound on the man’s chin, saying he could commit suicide. Chinese consulate officials told Xinhua that the earlier media report saying that the shooter is a Chinese is “just a speculation.” Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the incident and can make clear the gunman’s background in the coming one or two days, consulate officials said. Xinhua reporters who arrived at the scene shortly after the incident saw six obvious bullet holes in the consulate building, with one on the metal address plate of the building, two on the facade near surveillance cameras and three in the windows. A security guard of the consulate told Xinhua that the gunman shot at least 17 bullets before killing himself in his car. It was not immediately clear if the gunman had any political motive, local media cited police source as saying. The consulate general has expressed serious concerns about the shooting incident and urged the U.S. authorities to take all necessary measures to protect the safety of the building and diplomats working there, according to a press release on its official website. Officials from the consulate also told Xinhua that the consulate general opened to the public Tuesday as usual. (XinhuaNet)
