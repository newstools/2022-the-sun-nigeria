A Grade 1 Area Court sitting in Kado, Abuja, sentenced the trio of Ahmed, 22; Abdullahi, 21; and Bala 23 for joint act and theft. They pleaded guilty to the charges at the resumed hearing of the case on Monday. The judge, Alhaji Ahmed Ado, who handed down the verdict, however, gave them an option of N10, 000 fine each. Ado, who warned them to desist from committing crimes, said the punishment should serve as a deterrent to others. Before the judgement was delivered, the convicts pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy. Earlier, Police Prosecutor Judith Obatomi told the court that the accused were caught by some policemen on patrol in Gwarimpa area of  Abuja on Aug. 9. According to him, a brown carpet was recovered from them. The offences contravened Sections 79 and 288 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
