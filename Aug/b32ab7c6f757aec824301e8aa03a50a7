Oman airports are changing baggage rules to make security scanning a breeze and also to shield staff. These rules will come into effect from September 1. Passengers will no longer be allowed to check in round and irregular shaped luggage items wrapped in blankets, linen or tied with rope at the Muscat International, Salalah and Suhar airports, says a Times of Oman report. This change is applicable to all passengers, regardless of airline, cabin class or destination, the Oman Airports Management Company (OAMC) was quoted as saying in the report. OAMC will roll out a new baggage policy in all its airports. This will follow the highest standards and global operating procedures in the aviation industry. The new policy will facilitate faster pickups. It will also result in less baggage jams, and an overall smoother and hassle-free experience, the report points out. “For airport personnel, it will ensure the safety and security of baggage handlers, efficient check-ins and seamless access to checked baggage in case of further security screening,” the OAMC said. A senior staff member at OAMC told the daily: “The company wants to ensure that all airports in the Sultanate constantly achieve the highest overall quality performance, providing travellers with excellent facilities and service.” “We are telling travellers, ‘If the bag doesn’t lie flat, then consider repacking using appropriate suitcases and travel bags’. Baby strollers, bicycles, wheelchairs, golf bags will still be permitted.” The company is currently working closely with all airlines, travel agencies, tourism promotion websites, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to ensure that this policy is clearly communicated to all travellers to and from Oman, the report added.
