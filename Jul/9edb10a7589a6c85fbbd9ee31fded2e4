The trailer for Starling Pictures’ blockbuster movie, The Stranger I Know, will be unveiled today. Produced by Aderonke Moyinlorun and directed by Akin Tijani Balogun, The Stranger I Know parades some of Nollywood’s finest including Toyin Abraham, Deyemi Okanlawon, Aderonke Moyinlorun, Akin Lewis, Bimbo Akintola and Dayo Amusa. Set in Lagos and United States of America, The Stranger I Know revolves around an up and coming actor, who got her first lead role in a big budget Nollywood movie. He moves to Lagos and finds herself falling in love with her short-let landlord, a guy she just met. They have so much in common in a strange and scary way, which begs the question: is this a mere coincidence or there’s more to it than meets the eye? Speaking on the production, executive producer, Aderonke Moyinlorun, says: “The Stranger I Know is an original take that blends ancient tradition with modern way of life and love. I believe people would love it because it’s not only entertaining, but also intriguing, and will give the viewer a good cinematic experience. Our cast and crew did a wonderful job, and I cannot wait for you all to experience the magic we have created.” The movie will be in cinemas nationwide on August 19, 2022.
