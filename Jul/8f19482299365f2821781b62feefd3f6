From Lateef Dada, Osogbo Osun State Governor-elect Ademola Adeleke has cautioned his supporters against attacking members of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Some people who were said to be celebrating the victory of Adeleke have been destroying posters and billboards of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola since the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate as the winner of Saturday governorship election. The residence of Commissioner For Lands, Physical Planning & Urban Development, Nathaniel Agunbiade, was attacked by some people who are celebrating the victory of Adeleke in Erinmo-Ijesa, Oriade Local Government Area, on Monday. It was gathered that some aides to the commissioner were injured while vehicles and other properties were vandalised. In a statement signed by his spokesperson, Mallam Olawale Rasheed, Adeleke condemned the reported violent conduct of some youth celebrating his victory, dissociating himself and his political party from such negative activities. The statement reads: “it has come to the attention of the Governor-Elect that some youth are engaging in violent celebrations, leading to isolated attacks on vehicles and even individuals. This is unacceptable conduct and those involved in such behaviour are warned to stop forthwith.” He commiserated with the victims of the incident, the Adeleke Campaign Organisation informed the general public that it did not authorise any such demonstration and that those involved are not part of the Adeleke Campaign Organisation.
