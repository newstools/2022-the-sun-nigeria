From Emmanuel Adeyemi, Lokoja A People’s Democratic Party (PDP) women leader in Kogi State, Princess Grace Iye Adejoh, has said it was not enough for President Muhammadu Buhari to call on the members of the Academic staff union of universities (ASUU) to go back to class when he did not make any categorical statement on their demands saying the president should act swiftly to save the future of the students Princess Adejoh said it was worrisome for the president to be calling on stakeholders and friends of ASUU members to help beg them to call off the over six-month-old strike when he as the president of the nation refused to personally have a dialogue with the striking lecturers saying the president appears to be too cosmetic and indifferent to the plights of the students. President Buhari had urged ASUU to reconsider its position on its prolonged strike, expressing concerns about the generational consequences for families, the educational system and the country’s future development. A statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Monday quoted President Buhari lamenting how the strike had taken a toll on the psychology of parents and students and urged all well-meaning Nigerians, particularly those close to the ASUU’s leaders and members to intervene in persuading the lecturers to reconsider their position. But the PDP women leader said this is not enough as the president himself has to personally call on the striking lecturers to appeal to them and let them know the aspects of the demands that can be immediately met and ones that be put in view to enable the students to resume She said of all the demands, the issue of the UTAS payment system is uppermost which ASUU said has passed through an integrity test and wondered why the federal government is still foot-dragging on its approval. While noting that the continued staying at the home of students has caused serious psychological traumas on students and parents, she said the strike has also caused the rise in crime rate and prostitution in the country saying the government must do everything possible to end the strike within seven days. Princess Grace Iye Adejoh also appeals to the ASUU leadership not to allow ego and selfishness to taint their demands as the future of the students and the future of education in the country should be paramount.
