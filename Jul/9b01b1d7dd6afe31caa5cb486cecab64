Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, reaffirmed the commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to rule of law, attributing many of the problems in the society today to non-adherence to it. This came as the National Assembly plans to review laws on standardisation to make the operations of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) in tune with the global practice. The vice president, who was represented by his adviser on rule of law, Mr. Gbolahan Adeniran, at the public presentation of a book written by the Acting Director General of SON, Dr. Paul Angya, said SON would be given all the necessary support to enforce standards in the country. “We are in an administration that would not want to pay lip service to rule of law. There is nothing we can get right without rule of law; so we would support SON in the enforcement of standards,” Osinbajo stated. Minister of Industry, Trade and Investments, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah said SON was very critical to the economic diversification drive of the Federal Government, adding that the author “has genuine commitment to standardization, which is key to our industrialisation”. He expressed the hope that things would get better under the leadership of the Acting Director General. Chairman of the occasion, Senator Barnabas Gemade urged government to regenerate local production and manufacturing through standards. The book titled “Standardisation and quality regulation in Africa-Institutions and legal frameworks,” was reviewed by a former DG of SON, Dr. John Akanya. Akanya opined that corruption was endemic in the country due to dearth of standardisation, stressing that there would be anarchy without standards. “How can you move N5 billion without being tracked in a standardised system?,” he queried.
