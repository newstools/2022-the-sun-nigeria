Bishop of Calabar Anglican Communion, Nneoyi Egbe, yesterday, said in Calabar that Nigeria’s leaders must respect the country’s secularity for peace to reign. He said this during a news conference organised to herald the second session of the 11th Synod of the Calabar diocese of the communion. “We are driving steadily to another election, yet it is clear that the political gladiators parading the corridors of our political system have not learnt any lesson. “Enough of the recycling of the old politicians that has led us nowhere; we must register, collect our permanent voters’ cards (PVCs) and vote credible, young, fresh, visionary leaders with patriotic ideologies. “We appeal that Independent National Electoral Commission increases the number of registration materials, particularly the voter capture machines. “It makes no sense to deploy three or four units of such machines to a local government area,’’ he said. The bishop added that Nigerians have a rare opportunity to change the narrative of their national lives by choosing right at the 2023 general election. He challenged government to take a critical look at incessant strikes in the education sector and desist from engaging in ‘propaganda warfare’ with unions. Egbe stressed that government should increase funding of education significantly and be intentional about delivering quality education to Nigerians. The synod holds from July 13 to July 17 at the Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Ikom.
