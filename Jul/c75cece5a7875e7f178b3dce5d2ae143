From Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri The military said it discovered and removed over 150 Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) planted by terrorists while troops were on the trail of Boko Haram and its splinter group, the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) in northeastern Borno State. Theatre Commander, Joint Military Task Force North East, Operation Hardin Kai, Maj Gen Christopher Musa disclosed this in a remark in Maiduguri, Borno State during the presentation of medical equipment to troops in the area by the North East Development Commission (NEDC). Musa said each of the explosives was capable of causing greater damage to the military operational vehicles. “We started our major operations in February 2022; between February and March, we removed over 150 IEDs planted by Boko Haram. Each one has a capacity to destroy a vehicle and 10 men,” he disclosed. He said such devices would have affected the manpower of the military in the fight if conscious efforts were not made by the troops to remove them. He thanked the Chief of Army Staff for proving the leadership and operational vision to boost the war against insurgency and terrorism in the northeast. He asked the government to embark on the construction and rehabilitation of most of the roads in the area. He said such intervention would prevent the terrorists from having access.
