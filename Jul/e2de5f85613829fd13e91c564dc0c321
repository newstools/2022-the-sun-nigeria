Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu, has described sports as a sector that can provide employment for many but only if it can be maximally utilised and run professionally, reports Tribune Sports. The governor stated this in Abuja on Monday at a book presentation titled ‘Sports Law and Practice’ written by a barrister at law, a sports administrator and football agent, Dr. Emmanuel Oluwafemi Olowononi in conjunction with the Institute for Capacity Building, Entertainment and Sports Law Development (ICESLAD) which held at the Ladi Kwali Hall of the Sheraton Hotel. Akeredolu said the book would in no small way contribute to the growth and development of sports in Nigeria as it is coming to bridge the dearth of sports law and publication in Nigeria. He added that the book would add professionalism to how sports should be run in Nigeria and be of benefit to the country’s sports men and women. The Ondo governor said the book would serve as a working tool and reference for the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development and to advise the minister.  “In all ways the book will contribute to the growth of sports in Nigeria. You see when you have a dearth of publications on any area of life particularly on sports and you know sports is growing. Gone are those days when sports was all about amateurism. There is professionalism now in all sports. There are professional people who are athletes and footballers.  “This book has come at the right time to bridge the dearth of publication in sports law in Nigeria and this first book on sports law is going to open everybody’s eyes and will open doors to many lawyers who can now take it up. So many lawyers are being churned out by the Law School in their thousands and if a few of them can go into sports law or sports administration or become sports agents, a lot of money is there. This book will assist greatly because the author has given us a tool to work with.”
