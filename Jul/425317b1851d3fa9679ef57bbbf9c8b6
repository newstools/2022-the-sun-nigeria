By Joe Apu Leicester City and Super Falcons defender Ashleigh Plumptre says Nigeria will play against Zambia for the bronze medals of the 12th Women Africa Cup of Nations as if it’s the gold medal game. According to a release from the NFF, the defender said that the team is battle ready and will go all out for a win against the Copper Queens. “We have a mountain to surmount, surely, but we are ready and will approach the game like the Final match,” Plumptre said at Thursday’s pre-match conference. On his part, Coach Randy Waldrum is optimistic that the Super Falcons will give their all despite a rash of injuries and suspensions in the camp of the nine-time champions. “We have two players suspended as a result of red cards in the last game, and we also have some players down with injury. So, there will be changes but we will go for the best legs that would give us victory on Friday.” Captain Onome Ebi has been knocked out by a hamstring injury (biceps femoris muscle tear – Grade 2) and could require between six weeks to two months to recover. Forward Rasheedat Ajibade, who has been a cornerstone of Nigeria’s campaign with three goals to the kitty, picked up the Woman of the Match award in the quarter final defeat of Cameroon. She is out of today’s encounter alongside tenacious midfielder Halimatu Ayinde. Both were sent out in the match against the host nation. Head Coach of Copper Queens, Bruce Mwape will bank on team captain Grace Chanda to inspire the team against the Super Falcons.
