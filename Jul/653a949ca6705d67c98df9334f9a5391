Chimamanda Adichie, the Nigerian novelist-cum-feminist, appeared to have endorsed Peter Obi, the candidate of the Labour Party, ahead of the 2023 presidential race. Chimamanda expressed her admiration for Obi in a lengthy birthday message to the presidential aspirant via her Facebook page on Tuesday evening. Obi celebrated his 61st birthday on July 19. “I cannot wait to call you ‘My President,’” the award-winning writer wrote. “I cannot wait for February 25, 2023, when I, with personal pride in you and with hope for what Nigeria can become, will cast my vote for you and your running mate, Senator Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed.” The novelist recalled how Obi was there for her when she lost her dad and his “acts of kindness” to her family. In June 2020, the author lost James Adichie, her father, who died after a brief illness. Grace, her mother, died in March last year — about eight months after James. In the post, the writer appreciated Obi for “your kindness to my beloved parents” and for also “walking this still-unbearable journey of grief with my siblings and me”. She said she is inspired by the presidential aspirant’s “intellectual curiosity, eagerness to learn, genuine love of education (which is why you sought out, and honored)”. Chimamanda commended Obi for his “humane pragmatism” and for always exhibiting “your incredible generosity to the causes you believe in.”
