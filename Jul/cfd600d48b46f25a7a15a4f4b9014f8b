In a couple of weeks from now – July 18 to be precise – serial entrepreneur and billionaire pharmacist, Dr. Anthony Chukwuka Obiora will be 60. The Chairman of GreenLife Pharmaceuticals Ltd is also planning to retire once he hits this sixth floor. As the countdown to the 60th birthday shindig and retirement party hots up, family members, friends, business associates, staff members and catholic priests are in high spirits to celebrate this man of many parts. The Nnokwa, Anambra-born suave entrepreneur is also putting in place what it requires to make the day a one-stop celebration that will last long on the lips of Nigerians. Obiora, it was learnt, has also concluded to make the celebration special as he will unveil his autobiography titled: “My Wilderness Journey” to his guests and the entire world. The autobiography is about the captivating story of Obiora on how he conquered his world and rose to the very top by a dint of hard work. Obiora is one of those reclusive billionaires who would rather be heard through their impactful streaks than being seen. However, with optimism, some budding Nigerian entrepreneurs and the world cannot wait for the warm receipt of the book that will reveal the story of Obiora as he joins the sexagenarian club and goes into retirement from active running of his vast business empire.
