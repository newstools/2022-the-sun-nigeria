Shooting Stars of Ibadan fought back from two goals down to share the spoils with arch rivals, Rangers, a result that is considered a huge shot in the arm for their struggle to avoid relegation. To Coach Edith Agoye, the result was deserved even as he told Shooting Stars fans to banish their fears of the club getting relegated. On 44 points after 35 games and needing a win or at least a draw to create a distance from the struggling lot, the Oluyole Warriors had Moses Omodumueke to thank for two late goals that neutralised two earlier goals by Shedrack Asiegbu(46th) and Chidiebere Nwobodo (56th). Agoye, a former international and alumni of  3SC, said he was indeed satisfied with the outcome of the game, promising that they will definitely improve on their finishing in the next game against Rivers United in Ibadan. “It was a great game and a great comeback. I am completely satisfied with the fighting spirit of the players. They did well today and we are going back to work on our finishing which has always been a challenge” he said. The Ibadan outfit returned to the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) at the start of the season but have posted indifferent results, leaving them within the bracket of threatened teams. Despite ending the first stanza of the current league on a high, Rangers international have struggled particularly at away games and have lost three straight away games against Abia Warriors, Nasarawa United and Kano Pillars respectively. The host pressured, dominated and created the better opportunities in the first 45 mins but lacked the composure and direction to put the ball behind the net as the first half ended in a stalemate
