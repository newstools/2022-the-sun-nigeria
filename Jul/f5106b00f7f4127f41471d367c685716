The Minister of State for Transportation, Sen. Gbemisola Saraki,  says the Onitsha river port is positioned to generate over N23billion to the Federal Government in 30 years. Saraki, said during the signing of the concession of the port on Thursday in Abuja, that the port has  lots of economic benefits to the country. According to her, the port will among other things, ensure the 60 per cent shiped cargoes which hitherto goes through Onne port to Onitsha to be transported directly. ”So there is a lot of economic growth, there  is going to be creation of wealth, creation of jobs, security and greater development. ”We hope it is a catalyst for other river ports, so that it will decongest other ports and bring about  growth. “You know the traffic on our road, the state of our roads as well as the tankers,  and freight being moved on our roads have now reduced. “And so it is a very good thing and we are exceptionally proud that at long last we have actually achieved this. “It’s being signed and we look forward to the growth there to materialise,”Saraki said. According to the minister, the Baro, Lokoja and Oguta ports, which are at different stages of completion, will be considered after the onitsha port. “The most important thing is that we already have interest from potential investors who want to actually take over this.” The Managing Director, the National Inland Waterways Authority, (NIWA) Dr George Moghalu, said the Onitsha port would reduce the volume of cargoes transported via roads to the South East. He said:”Our roads are not designed to carry the kind of weight they are carrying. “Over 60 per cent  of the containers that arrive Nigeria through Onne, Tin Can or Apapa port ends up in Onitsha and what it translates is that these containers are moved by trailers.
