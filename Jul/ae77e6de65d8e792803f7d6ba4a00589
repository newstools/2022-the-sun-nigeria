Non-alcoholic wine brand, Eva, has announced the launch of ‘Search for Miss Eva’, a 5-week online beauty contest to choose a brand ambassador for the wine. According to the organiser, the ideal Miss Eva must be someone whose profile and personality resonate with the premium qualities of the Eva wine brand, which is known globally for its class, heritage, and beautifully unique packaging and sparkling taste. Speaking, Eva Group’s Country Manager, Mr. Temitope Akanji Sanni, said one of the driving forces of the brand is the desire to support the Nigerian youth through the media and entertainment industry. “The ‘Search for Miss Eva’ is a hybrid competition which will be held on social media and other online channels. It will also be broadcast to other traditional media channels such as radio and television,” he noted. Already, former BB Naija housemate, Anita Natasha Akide aka Tacha and Nollywood star, Deyemi Okanlawon have been appointed alongside other influencers to lead the search. The grand finale of the competition will take place live on Sunday August 7, 2022 at Marriot Hotels, Ikeja, Lagos.
