From Lateef Dada, Osogbo Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, yesterday, said only God and the masses would determine his success in the July 16 governorship election. He said with the introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), any attempt to rig any election would be an effort in futility. Oyetola, who took his reelection campaign to the hometown of Senator Ademola Adeleke, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Ede, expressed joy with the turn out of the people of the town. Speaking at Obalaoye Grammar School shortly after he received a royal blessing from the Timi of Edeland, Oba Munirudeen Lawal, the governor said that Ede road was the first he did after his inauguration. His words: “The forthcoming election slated for 16th July 2022 is very important for our state because God gave our party the power in Osun and Abuja. Power is not ready to leave our hands. Osun is for continuity. We have been able to ensure development for our state. “Ede road was the first rehabilitation project I did when I was sworn in as governor. The only way you can compensate me is by voting for our party, APC. “There is no room for rigging again,with the introduction of BVAS by INEC. Anyone plotting election malpractice is wasting time. God and the masses are on our side. I am impressed by the massive turnout here. I am surprised. It is a green light for APC in Ede.
