From Okwe Obi, Abuja   The presidential ambition of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, received a boost following the endorsement of his candidacy by the Northern Youths Coalition for Atiku-Okowa. The group’s National Coordinator, Suleiman Ibrahim Kuta, who spoke during the inauguration of state executive committees in Abuja, said the decision to support Atiku was based on his charisma, intelligence, experience, patriotism, inclusiveness, and reputation. Kuta maintained that Atiku remained the best man to tackle insecurity, revamp the economy and unite the country. He said: “We have identified that person and we are putting our time, energy, and resources to ensure that we set this country on the right path. “The 2023 general election, unlike any other, is an election in which we cannot afford any mistakes because our survival as a people and as a nation depends on it. “This is why we the Northern Youths have taken it upon ourselves to not just identify the right candidate but to also agitate, propagate and ensure that the right candidate emerges as the next President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Only one candidate has all these qualities and that candidate is Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the Wazirin Adamawa. He is the candidate equipped with all the necessary tools to pilot this country back to its glorious days.”
