From Tony Osauzo and Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin City Edo State House of Assembly has passed the Local Government Autonomy bill initiated by the National Assembly for consideration by the 36 states’ assemblies. At plenary, yesterday, Edo Assembly considered the fifth alteration of 44 bill transmission of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, resolved into the Committee of the Whole as moved by Hon Okhuarobo and seconded by the deputy speaker, Roland Asoro. Members dissected each altered bill one after the other and arrived at a unanimous decision to pass the amendment bill. The Speaker, Marcus Onobun, thereafter, requested that clean copies of the resolution be sent to relevant agencies. The Edo  Assembly, had on previous attempts, voted against Local Government Autonomy in 2012 and 2018 respectively. Meanwhile, the  leadership of the National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) Edo State chapter has commended the leadership and members of the Edo State House of Assembly for living up to the people’s rating of their legislative duties. In a statement jointly signed by its president, Adorolo Lazarus and secretary, Olumuyiwa Cole, Edo NULGE said: “The step taken by the current Edo State House of Assembly for the quick consideration and passage of the bill is highly commendable. While Nigerians await other state Houses of Assembly to join the progressive train, Edo House of Assembly has written its name in gold as the current and future generations  of workers and people at the third tier of government will remain eternally committed to benefiting from the dividend of democracy the passage of the bill would bring.” Edo NULGE called on other state Houses of Assembly that are yet to pass the bill to borrow a leaf from Edo and do the needful for posterity sake.
