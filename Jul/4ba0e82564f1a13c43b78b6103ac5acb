From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) has lauded the efforts of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at the just concluded Osun governorship election held over the weekend. In a statement titled, “Post Election Statement on the Gubernatorial Election in Osun State, July 2022”, signed by its chairman, Auwal Ibrahim Musa Rafsanjani, the body praised the electoral body for complying with the provisions of the Electoral Act, especially with regards to improving inclusivity by providing assistive technology for persons with disabilities, and for efficient election logistics arrangement which saw the early deployment of officials and materials to the polling units across the state of Osun. The group also praised the media and other stakeholders for their efforts in ensuring peaceful and non-violent elections and the people of the state for an inclusive and participatory election in state. “The 2022 Osun Governorship Election had generated much interest in the country just like the recently concluded gubernatorial election in Ekiti. “The off-season elections generated high expectations among citizens, not just in Ekiti and Osun, but all over the country as it was expected to reflect citizens’ expectations towards the General Election in 2023, especially with regards to the reforms instituted by the new Electoral Act, 2022 as amended. TMG, which monitored the electioneering process, expressed satisfaction with the high level of voter mobilisation activities carried out by the media and civil society organisations. It emphasised voters’ willingness to exercise their franchise in election debates, thereby ensuring critical interactions with citizens as part of entrenching issue-based campaigns. Regarding vote buying, TMG insisted that voters must avoid selling their future and good governance because vote buying does not provide good governance, transparency, or accountability. It did, however, urge security personnel to conduct themselves with the utmost decency in order to maintain voters’ trust in future elections.
