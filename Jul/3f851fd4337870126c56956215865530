From Noah Ebije, Kaduna Worried by poor results of voter registration in the North West, the zonal office of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has concluded arrangements to establish a special room that will monitor the progress of the exercise in the zone. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna on Thursday, the National Vice Chairman (North West), Salihu Lukman, noted that the statistic coming out in regards to voters’ registration in the zone is worrisome. He pointed out that, “as leaders, given the mandate to steer the activities in the zone we feel there is the need to do everything to correct it. “We have decided to take steps to address the situation. To this end, we have resolved to set up what we call the special room”. He said. According to him, the zonal office will look at the ways and means of establishing stronger relationships with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) regarding the registration of voters. He said this has become necessary because there are some areas where the necessary logistics were not provided by the electoral body. “We will take all the appropriate steps to ensure that this is done. Thus, we want to appeal to the general public especially our members and supporters to do anything necessary to ensure that the issue of registration is given adequate priority. “Unless we have registered voters, how many supporters we have will not make sense. So, for us, this issue is very central ” Fortunately even with our recent meeting with the Governors, Ministers and other stakeholders in the zone, they advised we should set up a research and planning committee. This is what we are going to do today. And members of the committee will be in charge of the special room,” he stated.
