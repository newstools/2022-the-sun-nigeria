From Laide Raheem, Abeokuta   Ahead of the 2023 general election, scores of loyalists of the immediate past governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, have switched camp and pledged their allegiance to Dapo Abiodun, the incumbent governor. The former loyalists of Senator Amosun who are members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of the state were received by the Senior Special Adviser on Political Affairs to the Governor, Samson Tunji Egbetokun, on Friday. Addressing the decampees, Egbetokun commended them for their decision to join the mainstream of the APC in the state and team up with the governor ahead of the general poll next year. “You have got it right by taking this bold step in the sense that one cannot say because of sympathy you continue to stay with somebody and become useless. You should know what you want, where to get it and how to get it. “We have a governor who is passionate with inclusiveness, justice and fairness. You can see that even if you join the party today, he takes and recognizes you as someone who had been with the party from the inception. Politics is parochial; it is how to better your life and that of others. You cannot do politics with emotions. I want to welcome you to Dapo Abiodun’s family and since you are not strangers, you will be promptly integrated,” Egbetokun stated.
