From Noah Ebije, Kaduna The Kaduna State governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Senator Uba Sani has picked governor Nasir El-Rufai’s deputy, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, a fellow Muslim as his running mate for the 2023 governorship elections in the State. However, Southern Kaduna People’s Union (SOKAPU) had few months ago kicked against Muslim-Muslim ticket for governorship election in the State. The National President of SOKAPU, Jonathan Asake had before now said that any governorship candidate that picked a fellow Muslim as running mate would not enjoy the Union’s support. Asake said the people have not forgiven the State governor, Nasir El-rufai for introducing Muslim- Muslim ticket in 2018 and picked Hadiza Balarabe as his running mate for the 2019 election. However, Sani who made the announcement on Monday night after consultations with critical stakeholders of Kaduna State, said ” I am happy to announce that I have picked Her Excellency, Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe as my running mate in the 2023 governorship election in Kaduna State.” The lawmaker said Dr. Balarabe has contributed immensely to the giant strides recorded by the governor El-Rufai’s administration in infrastructure and human capital development. He added that, “Dr. Balarabe has demonstrated hard work, punctuality, dedication and team spirit in the discharge of her responsibility as Deputy Governor which has endeared her to the critical stakeholders in the State. “I wish to therefore call on the good people of Kaduna State to support the choice of Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe as my running mate. I also enjoin them coming out en-masse to vote for our ticket during the forthcoming 2023 general election. Your mandate in 2023 will enable us to build a peaceful, prosperous, and greater Kaduna State. “Together, we are determined to make the State a reference point for good and responsive governance,” Sani stated.
