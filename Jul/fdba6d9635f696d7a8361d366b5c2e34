He particularly blamed the attack on the lackadaisical response of the military, despite getting a prior alert from the secret police before the attack. But in its reaction, the DHQ said the allegations against it by Mr Fani-Kayode were untrue and unsubstantiated. “In all these allegations, Mr Kayode is merely playing to the gallery. He is not in any position to know whether the DSS notified the military of any attack or not. It may not be impossible that such a claim is part of a calculated attempt to cause division and rivalry amongst all Government Agencies that have been working collaboratively in addressing issues of insecurity in the country,” Major Gen. Akpor, spokesperson of the DHQ, said.
