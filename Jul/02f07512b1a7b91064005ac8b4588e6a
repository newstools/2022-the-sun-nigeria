Mali’s senior man’s basketball team continued their strike for the second consecutive game as they boycotted their game against Nigeria’s D’Tigers. The scenario saw Nigeria booking  their place in the next round of the FIBA World Cup qualifiers in Kigali after they were awarded a 20-0 win over Mali in their Group A meeting following a walk-over. Both sides were due to meet in the second group game of this international window after the D’Tigers fell to a defeat at the hands of Cape Verde on Friday. On the same day, Mali refused to take to the court against Uganda, leading to the award of a 20-0 win to the East African nation. The D’Tigers enjoyed the same privilege as their West African neighbours continued to protest against their unpaid wages and bonuses and refused to honour the fixture. As a result, the Nigerians secured a place in the next round of the qualifiers in August after being awarded a 20-point win in the match.
