Manchester United superstar Cristiano Ronaldo dropped a major hint he may stay at Old Trafford after all. Ronaldo rocked United when he expressed his desire to leave in the summer as he wants to play in the Champions League this coming season. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner didn’t join the Red Devils for pre-season in the Far East and Australia due to “family reasons”. Thus, he missed out again today when his side were held to a 2-2 draw against Premier League foes Aston Villa in Perth. But the star forward has been training hard on his own as he shared snaps of his latest workout session on Instagram. And the Portugal captain appears to have hinted he is actually going nowhere as he donned a pair of last season’s United training shorts. Ronaldo showed off his trimmed physique as he posed topless for pictures while working out.
