From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Assassins struck again in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, on Friday, killing a chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party, Mr Odeinyefa Ogbolosingha. Ogbolosingha is the fourth person to be gruesomely murdered in Bayelsa in less than two months fueling fears of violent crime in the state. According to investigations, the masked assassins dressed in military camouflage traced the deceased to his house along Imiringi road where he was shot on the head at close range and also on the arm and shoulder. The deceased aged 53, an administrative officer in the state civil service and Secretary, Okordia/Zarama Cluster Development Board, was killed a few hours after discharging his ailing wife from the hospital to the house. Eyewitness accounts said two other people who were in the house were shot in the legs when they rushed out on hearing the gunshots that killed Ogbolosingha. Findings indicated that the killing of Ogbolosingha is linked to the lingering crisis in the Kalaba community where the paramount ruler and the Community Development Committee (CDC) chairman were recently brutally murdered over their refusal to concede to the setting up of an illegal refinery in the area. Security sources said there is a recommendation before the state government calling for a quick resolution of the crisis consuming the Kalaba community to avert more violent deaths. ”Some names were mentioned in the Kalaba crisis and the state government has been told to intervene to stop these killings. It is enough.” The Spokesman of the Bayelsa State Police Command, Asinim Butswat, who confirmed the development, stated: “Police operatives responded to a distress call at about 1400 hours on Friday 22 July 2022, that armed men shot one Odeinyefa Ogbolosingha at his residence at Imiringi road, Yenagoa. The victim was rushed to the Federal Medical Centre Yenagoa for treatment but was confirmed dead. Investigation has commenced.”
