Fashion designer, Kayina Eno Ofu aka Kayi, has emerged winner of the maiden edition of The Game reality TV show. She defeated 32 other contestants to emerge victorious and went home with a car and prizes worth N10 million. The 1st runner-up is Okoko Osinachi Augustine while Jessica Peter emerged as the 2nd runner-up. According to Demola Olufowobi, the show’s director/consultant, “The Game is a platform for young people to showcase themselves in the entertainment industry. This is the maiden edition and I believe subsequent editions will be better.”  Kayina, who received her car last Saturday, said she’s very excited to be the winner of the show. “We stayed in the house for 30 days and it has not been easy, but the show has groomed me towards my entry into the entertainment industry. Though, I went into the house as a novice, I learnt a lot of things and have been able to harness my hidden talents. At first, I felt like going home but remembering that I attended the show for a purpose, I had to hold on to my faith, as I interacted with other contestants and adapted to the things in the house.”  She stated further: “I will join my church choir in order to develop my musical talent and later take it as a profession. As an ambassador of The Game show, I will work with others to show how I can impact society positively through my work. As the winner, I will invest the money in my fashion business and will bring out new collections.”  On her part, Jessica Peter said: “I promise to make use of all the things that I learnt in the house. One of the major things that I learned from the house is how to accommodate people. I like to be on my own but in a house with 32 contestants, somebody made it a point of duty to step on my toes but with perseverance, I was able to overcome the challenge.”
