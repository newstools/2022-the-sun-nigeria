He said that when the complainant caught the convict he brought out a knife and threatened to kill him in order to escape with the stolen item. The prosecutor added that during police investigation, the convict made a confessional statement and the kitchen Sink and knife were recovered from him. Ogada told the court that the offence contravened Sections 348,397 and 287 of the Penal Code.
