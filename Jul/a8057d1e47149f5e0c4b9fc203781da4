This is a foreseen but unintended consequence of the aviation fuel scarcity in the country. “We, therefore, plead for the understanding of the travelling public to bear with our members as efforts are currently being made to address the development and restore normal flight operations. AON is committed to rendering seamless and uninterrupted air transport service across the country,” he said.
