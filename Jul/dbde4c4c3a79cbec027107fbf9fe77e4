World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) boss Vince McMahon, who turned the firm from a regional player to global giant, says he will retire amid a flurry of misconduct claims. He stepped down from his roles in WWE last month following reports he paid millions to suppress allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity. Mr. McMahon remains WWE’s majority shareholder. He has led WWE for decades, often appearing as a performer in the ring. In a statement that did not mention the allegations against him, Mr. McMahon said he has the “deepest appreciation and admiration for our generations of fans all over the world”. “Our global audience can take comfort in knowing WWE will continue to entertain you with the same fervour, dedication, and passion as always,” the 76-year-old said.
