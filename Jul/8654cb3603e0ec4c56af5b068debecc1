In March, Ghana pipped archrivals Nigeria on the away goals rule to qualify for the World Cup. However, the Super Eagles new coach, Peseiro has insisted that his team is better than the Black Stars and ought to be one at Qatar 2022.  “I have a team with players who play in England, Italy, France, Spain, but unfortunately they didn’t beat Ghana to go to the World Cup,” Peseiro said in an interview.  “But I think it was an accident, I think Nigeria are better than Ghana.” Peseiro has since taken over the Eagles following the World Cup disaster and has promised to lead the team to win a fourth AFCON title.
