From Godwin Tsa, Abuja A High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja has refused to vacate its order restraining the Minister of the FCT, Muhammad Bello, from further demolishing the Abuja residence of Prince Joseph Kpokpogri, former lover of popular Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh. The preservative order was secured for the Abuja socialite, by his team of lawyers, led by Chief Mike Ozekhome SAN. Justice Charles Agbaza in his ruling held that the order would subsist until the hearing and determination of the suit the claimant brought before the court. “This court has the powers to grant an extension of the order in exercise of its discretion so as to preserve the Res (subject matter) of this suit. “It will serve the interest of justice to allow the order to remain alive until the determination of the matter. Accordingly, this matter is hereby adjourned till September 12,” Justice Agbaza held. The FCT minister had, through his lawyer, Mr. Y. Abubakar, urged the court to vacate the restraining order, which he said ought to elapse after seven days. “It is exactly eight days after the order was made. The rule of this court provides that such order shall abate after seven days and there is no formal application for its extension”, Abubakar submitted. However, counsel representing the claimant, Mr. Richard Ebie, urged the court to revalidate the order, which he argued had no definite lifespan until the determination of the case. After he had listened to both sides, Justice Agbaza dismissed the oral application by counsel to the FCT Minister. Ozekhome had at the last adjourned date, told the court that some persons from the Federal Capital Development Authority, FCDA, had on May 14, invaded his client’s residence, “accompanied by a multitude of heavily armed policemen and bulldozers and excavators,” and commenced the demolition of his house, beginning with the boys quarters.
