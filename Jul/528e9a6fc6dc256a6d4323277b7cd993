Ahead of their final group game on Sunday at the ongoing Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Morroco, the Super Falcons have been charged to end this phase in style as they take on their counterparts from Burundi. Already back to winning ways after the shaky start against South Africa’s Bayana Bayana, Amstel Malta Ultra, the official Malt drink of the Super Falcons enjoined the women’s national team to make a statement with Sunday’s final group game against the debutants. Burundi are already down and out after successive defeats in the hands of Botswana and South Africa, so they would only be battling for ‘pride’ against Nigeria. Aside from only getting the three points from Sunday’s outing, Amstel Malta Ultra is charging the Super Falcons to go for goals that would see them soaring high into the quarter-final full of confidence. So far, the Super Falcons have scored three goals in two matches coming from the trio of Rasheedat Ajibade, Ifeoma Onumonu and  Christy Ucheibe. Speaking ahead of Sunday’s tie against Burundi, Amstel Malta Brand Manager, Maire Abia-Bassey expressed delight in the continued improvement shown by the Super Falcons even as she fully backs the team to teach Burundi some football lessons. “I am very happy the Super Falcons are getting better with every game they play,  I don’t expect anything less from them when they face Burundi on Sunday” she declared. On the anticipation of a big win, the Amstel Malta Brand Manager said Randy Waldrum and his Ladies are equal to the task. “I think getting a big win will further boost their confidence, they did well against Botswana and would definitely do better against Burundi I believe” she added. The Super Falcons look destined for a second-place finish in Group C and would be up against the second-best team in Group B which houses Cameroon, Tunisia, Togo and Zambia.
