One of Nigeria’s foremost gospel/folk musicians, Sola Allyson, who recently released her 10th album, Imisi, has counted her blessings of almost two decades singing career. Allyson, who held a concert last weekend to celebrate a successful music journey, said her latest album is not really different from others she has released. “There is a way I write my songs, and that’s the way I always want it to be with a theme of hope, love, encouragement and worship. Technically, things are getting better with my productions but the spirit is the spirit always. I get inspired all the time because I’m always ready to receive, as I don’t play with my time. There are some songs in my album that I have received long before now. I receive things to say and do all the time.” Admitting that many have heard her music and got blessed by her ministrations, Allyson said, “I’m not just singing for singing sake, as my music suits intuitive listening. So, I’m intentional and deliberate about the way I express my songs and when people hear them they say it’s deep. I have been privileged to find my soul’s path. So, the way my music is, there are many people who don’t understand the language I’m singing in, but the message and essence of my music blesses them.”
