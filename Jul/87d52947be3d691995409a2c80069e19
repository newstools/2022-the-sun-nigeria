From Obinna Odogwu, Awka Catholic Bishop of Ekwulobia Diocese, His Eminence, Cardinal Peter Okpalaeke, has inaugurated an ICT centre donated to Uga community in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State by Johnbosco Anaedobe. Anaedobe, popularly called Uga-na-Uga, donated the fully equipped ICT centre to the community to serve as a “springboard through which the next generation of Nigerians will compete with the rest of the world in technological innovations.” The cardinal, shortly after consecrating the facility for use, commended the donor for coming up with the initiative, saying that the ICT centre would add positive values to the lives of those who would make use of it and the society in general. He called on other well meaning individuals in the state to emulate Anaedobe by donating ICT centres to their communities as the world is now at the digital era where information technology rules the world. The philanthropist who is also the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Aguata 1 constituency in the House of Assembly in the 2023 election, said that the facility would serve as a centre where the children learn coding and other aspects of computing early in life. “There’s no doubt that the knowledge economy led by technology is the next phase of economic prosperity. Africa lost out in the industrialisation age and we must do everything to feature in the technological phase,” he stated. It was gathered that the facility would also serve as a UTME centre for students within that area and as such would save them the stress of travelling long distances to take the exams.
