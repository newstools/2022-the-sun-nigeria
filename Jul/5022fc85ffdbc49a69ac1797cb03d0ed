Raheem Sterling has agreed personal terms with Chelsea after officially informing Manchester City that it is the right time for him to leave. Sportsmail understands that the England international finalised the terms of a contract with Chelsea during talks alongside his lawyer. Blues boss Thomas Tuchel held positive discussions with the 27-year-old prior to those negotiations, centred on how he would be utilised at Stamford Bridge which helped solidify Sterling’s desire to make the move. Sterling is set to become the first marquee signing under Chelsea’s new ownership, spearheaded by chairman Todd Boehly, with the two clubs thrashing out a fee. It is believed that City formally discussed Sterling’s desire to bring an end to a stellar seven-year stay at the Etihad Stadium at the beginning of June during a conversation led by the England international. The Premier League champions afforded the forward time to determine his next steps and the relationship is ending amicably. Sterling has appreciated the space to assess his options and is thankful for the transparency that both parties have committed to. Chelsea are expected to hit the valuation, thought to be around £55million, for a player entering the final 12 months of a £300,000-a-week contract. Sterling will earn in the region of £315,000-per-week at Chelsea, where he will sign a long term contract.
