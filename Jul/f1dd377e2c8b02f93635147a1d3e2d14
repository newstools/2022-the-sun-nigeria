From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan    A former governor of the old Oyo State, Dr. Victor Omololu Olunloyo, an 87-year-old trained mathematician, is alive but in critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Oyo State. Many online media platforms had yesterday morning reported the death of the Second Republic governor of the old Oyo State, saying he lost the battle to undisclosed ailments. However, the family of the former governor dispelled the reports, and called for prayers for his quick recovery. Olunloyo was governor of the old Oyo State for three months, which started on October 1, 1983 and ended on December 31 of the same year.  When Sunday Sun visited his Molete residence, the main gate to his house was locked with a padlock from outside. He was said to have reportedly fainted before being rushed to UCH, where he was reportedly resuscitated, and placed on life support. When Sunday Sun visited the hospital, authorities did not allow this reporter to catch a glimpse of him. A statement titled, Official Statement from the Olunloyo Family, issued on yesterday morning, and directed to all Nigerians and well-wishers, read in part: “We appreciate the public for the interest shown in the wellbeing of our father, Chief Dr. Victor Omololu Sowemimo Olunloyo, also known as VOSO. “In the tradition of the Olunloyo family of Ibadanland, and based on the principles of integrity, inclusion, and openness upon which our revered father, VOSO, has always stood, we would like to inform the Nigerian public that we would greatly appreciate your prayers for our father, who is presently in the ICU at UCH Ibadan.”
