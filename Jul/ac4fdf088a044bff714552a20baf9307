From Priscilla Ediare, Ado Ekiti The Segun Oni Campaign Organisation (SOCO) has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of deliberately delaying upload of results of the June 18 governorship election on Ekiti State on its server in order to perfect the falsified figures of results awarded to the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Mr Biodun Oyebamiji, as the winner. The Director of Media and Publicity of the Campaign Organisation, Mr Jackson Adebayo stated this in a press statement made available to journalists in Ado Ekiti, on Saturday. Adebayo said as of Saturday, July 2, the INEC summary of local government results on Form EC8C and summary of Ekiti State election results on form EC8D are yet to be uploaded on the server thereby making a compilation of materials by the legal team and filing of a petition by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) governorship candidate, Asiwaju Segun Oni to challenge the victory of the APC candidate, Mr Biodun Oyebamiji at the election petition tribunal pretty difficult. The SOCO’s Spokesman who said so far INEC has uploaded a summary of units results on Form EC8A and Ward results on Form EC8B wondered why the INEC should be afraid to upload the results if not for the reasons of wanting to perfect the falsified figures it has used to rig for the APC perfectly before uploading the results to its server. Adebayo said this should be investigated because the INEC has no excuse for withholding the upload of the results two weeks after the election.
