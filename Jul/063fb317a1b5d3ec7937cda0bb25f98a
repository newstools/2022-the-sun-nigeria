By Chinwendu Obienyi The Group Chief Executive Officer, Airtel Africa, Segun Ogunsanya, has stated that the take-off of its SmartCash Payment Service Bank (PSB) would help deepen financial inclusion and create new job opportunities in Nigeria. Ogunsanya, who made this known to newsmen while speaking at the launch of the PSB in Lagos at the weekend, also assured that the payment solution would create more value to shareholders. According to him, the operations of the PSB would empower many Nigerians financially and bring, most especially, people in the rural areas into the banking system. Ogunsanya noted that the bank which has its headquarters, is set to revolutionise the Nigerian payment system while adding that it would advance the cashless economy initiative of the federal government and bring millions of people in urban and rural areas into the financial community.  “We will transform their lives, bring them out of poverty and also bring convenience to the ones who are already financially included. With SmartCash PSB, your phone is your bank. Aside from the benefits to our customers, we are onboarding a very large number of agents for cash in and cash out, through which we are creating new jobs in our various communities, which is also a boost to the nation’s economy. Our main objective is to bring the 55 per cent of the unbanked Nigerian population into the financial system. In this way, we are working with the Central Bank of Nigeria to ensure that no Nigeria is left out of the financial system”, He said. Also speaking at the event, the Chief Executive Officer of SmartCash, Muyiwa Ebitomi, said SmartCash PSB was designed to receive cash deposits, process payments and remittances; issuance of debit and prepaid cards; operate electronic wallets among other payment services.  According to him, removing the barriers and increasing accessibility to banking services, especially the financially excluded, remains a priority to Airtel Africa.
