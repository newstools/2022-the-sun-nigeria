By Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos Embattled Nollywood actor Olanrewaju Omiyinka James (aka Baba Ijesha) has been convicted and sentenced to 16 years imprisonment over the sexual assault and defilement allegations levelled against him. The convict was sentenced on Thursday by Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Special and Sexual Offences Court of the Lagos State High Court, Ikeja. Baba Ijesha was accused of sexually molesting an adopted daughter of another colleague, Damilola Adekoya, also known as Princess. He was charged with indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault – which contravenes Sections 135, 137, 261, 202, 262 and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015. Omiyinka has denied all the allegations, but a video detailing his relationship with the girl said to be a minor was played in court to confirm his involvement in the crime by the prosecution. Delivering the judgement, the trial judge, Justice Taiwo, found the defendant guilty of four offences out of the six counts he stood trial for bordering on allegations of indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration, and sexual assault by penetration. Baba Ijesha was pronounced guilty of counts two, three, four and five but the court absolve him of counts one and six due to the prosecution’s failure to prove the allegations. He was found guilty of indecent treatment of a child and sexual assault, which is contrary to Section 135 of Lagos State Criminal Law 2015.
