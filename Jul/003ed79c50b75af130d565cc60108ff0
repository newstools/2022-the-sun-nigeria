From Okwe Obi, Abuja Social vices like greed and gambling addiction, among others, have been exposed in a movie titled ‘Too Sure To Lose’. The producer, Kingsley Akam, explained that the movie tries to correct social dysfunction which is partly caused by poverty and the insatiable desire of young people to make money illicitly. Akam, who is a lecturer in the Department of Theatre and Media Studies, University of Calabar (UNICAL), noted that the unsavoury practices dent the image of the country before the international community. Aside from assuring Nigerians of his desire to change the negative narrative through movies, he enjoined citizens to join the fray against immoral behaviour. Speaking on the synopsis of the movie, Akam said: “‘Too Sure To Lose’ treats issues bordering on effects of greed, desperation, addiction, parenting, and parental influence on child’s choice of profession. “The film typifies social reality in the way most people invest in betting games and hope to be wealthy faster through such means. “The story revolves around a final year law student who spent his years gambling with his school fees and could not graduate from the university.”
