Bishop of the Idoani Anglican Diocese, Ondo State, Reverend Agara Adegoke, has said the church would bring the breast cancer awareness to its congregation as part of their forthcoming Synod’s activities. Reverend Adegoke spoke when the Breast Cancer Association of Nigeria (BRECAN), founded by wife of the Ondo State Governor, Chief (Mrs) Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, took its breast cancer awareness creation and free screening to Idoani community in Ose Local Government Area of the state. Speaking at the event held at the premises of the Holy Trinity Anglican Diocese, Idoani, the bishop said: “Breast cancer is something that has become very serious in our time and for the governor’s wife to have taken it upon herself to be involved in awareness creation, we just need to encourage her and thank God for the vision, and I pray the vision will remain forever.” Also speaking, Mrs. Akeredolu commended the 2022 Synod’s committee of the Diocese for inculcating breast cancer awareness into the activities of event. Represented by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Administration, Mrs. Lizzy Akpan, Mrs. Akeredolu said the event would serve as a template for other religious organisations in creating breast cancer awareness among their congregations. She said she was delighted with the church’s decision to educate worshippers about the disease, adding that she was optimistic that other religious leaders would emulate such, rather than convincing members that breast cancer is a spiritual attack. Many women in the community benefited from the free clinical breast screening and enlightenment on how to be self aware of the condition of their breasts.
