From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri Counsellors of the All Progressives Congress(APC) loyal to Imo Governor Hope Uzodinma and Senator Rochas Okorocha from Ihitte Uboma Local Government Area of the state at the weekend buried their hatchets. Both factions comprised of the serving and former counsellors have been at political loggerheads since Uzodinma assumed office over two years ago. But their political differences were mediated by a party chieftain from the council area who is also the state Commissioner for Special Duties, Okey Anukwuem, who gathered the 32 lawmakers at his residence for a sumptuous lunch. Addressing the counsellors, Anukwuem said their unity would help foster peace in their local government and the State and as well encourage the governor to concentrate on his connecting the state to national politics. Also, a member representing Okigwe South at the House of Representatives, Chika Okafor, who was present at the peace meeting urged the counsellors to always have the interest of the party at heart above other things. Earlier, the Ihitte Uboma APC chairman, Innocent Chibundu, who was also a former counsellor testified that there was no love lost between Uzodinma and Okorocha’s loyalists.
