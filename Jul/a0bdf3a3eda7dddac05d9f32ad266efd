Super Falcons stars have been paid a paltry $1,000 each out of $10,000 by the Nigeria Football Federation, reports BSNSports.com.ng. British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) World Football Correspondent and former NFF Reforms Committee Member, Osasu Obayiuwana informed on his verified Twitter handle of the development on Wednesday night. His tweet read: “Players of the Super Falcons have reportedly received $1k of the minimum $10k they’re entitled to. “Coach Randy Waldrum got $2k and assistant coaches $1.5k. Backroom staff got $1k each. When will they be paid the remaining cash?” Recall players of the Super Falcons did not take part in a training programme that was scheduled for Wednesday morning in Casablanca.
