Lagos based musical artiste and Rap sensation, Cosmas Okechukwu Nnotum, has bared his mind on the most challenging moment of his musical career. Cosmas Nnotum was responding to questions on his Instagram social media handle @Supaakos, when fans of the Rap Artiste made enquiries about him. On his journey so far in his musical career, he said, “It took me 10 years to get to this point alongside Riosoundz and those were very frustrating times as we made so many great songs that unfortunately could not see the light of day. That really hurt because I put my heart in those songs but at the end of the day, life goes on and you have to keep on moving. Luckily the door opened again when frankly I least expected and this has brought credence to the saying that God’s time is the best because He is the one that has created this opportunity for my music to be heard again.” Fans have poured encomium on Cosmas Nnotum on his legendary musical rap, likening him to the great Tu Pac Shakur.
