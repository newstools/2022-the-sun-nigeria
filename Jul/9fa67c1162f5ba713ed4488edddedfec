From Obinna Odogwu, Awka First Lady of Anambra State, Nonye Soludo, has called on governments, at all levels, to take more actions to end or, at least, reduce to bearable minimum, infant and maternal mortality in Nigeria. Specifically, Mrs Soludo demanded that quicker and bolder steps should be taken to meet up with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the mortality ratio in the country, especially in the state. The first lady, who spoke in Awka, the state capital, said although 2030 was just eight years away from now, the global target could be met if guided, faster and strategic actions were taken from this year. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nigeria accounts for about 34 per cent of global maternal deaths and reducing the mortality rate is a central theme under SDGs 3. Although, Mrs Soludo said the state, being governed by her husband, has started taking positive steps to address the trend, stronger health policies, recruitment of committed healthcare workers and procurement of high-level equipment for healthcare centres were needed to achieve the target. She said to achieve the SDGs for maternal and newborn health (MNH) in Nigeria by 2030, the number of maternal fatalities must decrease by more than 90 to less than 3,000 per year. The governor’s wife also noted that promoting health education and strategic health campaigns could yield good results in the efforts to checkmate the fatalities, insisting governments, at all levels, must show stronger determination to nip the trend. Mrs Soludo said the recruitment of healthcare professionals by her husband’s administration, along with other primary health development policies, would provide the platform needed to achieve long term goals.
