From Aloysius Attah, Onitsha President of Anglican Women Ministry and the wife of the Bishop on the Niger, Dr. Elsie Nonyelum Nwokolo, has called for a ban on open grazing in Nigeria as the solution to the persistent conflict between farmers and herdsmen. Speaking yesterday during the Diocesan Women Conference of the diocese at St. Philip’s Anglican Church, Ogidi, Nwokolo alleged that herdsmen recently burnt the plantation farm of the women ministry to allow their cattle graze. She also called on the Federal Government to listen to the citizens’ cry for restructuring, saying this would restore patriotic spirit in the populace. The president also reminded Anambra State government of its promise to build the road to the ministry’s retreat camp at Umunya. Drawing from her speech, leader of the Progressive People’s Alliance (PPA) in Anambra State and governorship aspirant, Mr. Godwin Ezeemo, traced the black man’s problem to greed and selfishness of leadership. He said he has dared to be different and would model what effective leadership should be if given the chance as governor of the state. “The black man has not been subduing the earth as directed in the bible, but has been using his God-given knowledge to work against one another,” he said.
