Vice President Yemi Osinbajo,  on Monday said the Federal Government was  making progress in the construction  work on the Lagos-Abidjan highway corridor as awll as other issues bordering free movement of goods and services within the subregion. Osinbajo’s spokesman, Laolu Akande, in a statement in Abuja, said the vice president spoke with newsmen after the 61st Ordinary Session of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held in Accra, Ghana. The Lagos- Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway is part of the Trans-African Highway within the ECOWAS region. The Vice President said that at meeting, President Sissoco Embaló of Guinea-Bissau, assumed chairmanship of the ECOWAS, alongside a newly composed Commission. He said there were high expectations regarding the output of the body and the leaders must work harder to resolve lingering issues in the region. “President Nana Akufo-Addo did an excellent job in a very challenging period in the history of ECOWAS and many of the challenges remain.“So, we expect that the new leadership will take over and work as hard and perhaps much harder to resolve some of the issues. “There are even additional challenges today – economic challenges, especially with the Russian-Ukraine crisis, and economic problems. “Other issues are the coups that have taken place in the region in the past couple of years and we are still trying to resolve some of those issues. “The new leadership under President Sissoco Embaló must step up efforts and address those very many responsibilities that the region faces today.” Osinbajo added, however, that besides the challenges, the region was witnessing appreciable progress in the ECOWAS common currency policy. According to him, these are things ECOWAS citizens should be happy about. “Also, there is progress being made on the Lagos-Abidjan Corridor, some of the issues around the movement of goods and services on that corridor.
