Nigeria National League (NNL) campaigner, JM Liberty FC of Makurdi has cried out to the chieftains of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), the Nigeria National League (NNL) and well meaning football stakeholders in the country demanding justice in their match against Adamawa United in Week 20 of the 2021/22 NNL season. JM Liberty FC, in its petition to the Chief Operating Officer, NNL, Emmanuel Adesanya, claimed that Adamawa United inability to provide valid license in the said match played at Atiku Abubakar Stadium, Fufore in Adamawa State is enough reasons to upturn the result of the match in their favour. The said match was originally fixed for Wednesday but was later rescheduled for Thursday morning by the NNL with the homers, Adamawa United winning by 2-1. JM Liberty claimed that Adamawa United played the match with only 13 valid licenses presented at the match venue. “Adamawa United dressed 20 players for the match out of which 7 players did not have any license” The president of the Makurdi side, Jeremiah Avungu quoted the rules and regulation guiding the NNL league to our correspondent. According to him, “the NNL in her circular 202 dated 13th May, 2022 warned in strong terms that only valid license shall be accepted in the remaining part of the league. Avungu alleged that the match commissioner Shuaibu Mohammed (Gombe state) was almost turning to “kill-joy” to the team by frustrating all their efforts to get justice claiming to be acting on directives from above.
