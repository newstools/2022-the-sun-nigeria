From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan Justice Ladiran Akintola of Oyo State High Court, sitting in Ibadan, will today deliver a judgment on a litigation instituted by the Deputy Governor, Rauf Olaniyan, against the House of Assembly, to stop impeachment moves against him. The court had, on July 6, adjourned the case to July 26, 2022 for judgment. However, the judgment has been brought forward, probably based on the urgency of the matters involved. As gathered, counsel to the parties in the suit have been duly notified that the judgment would be delivered today. The counsel are Afolabi Fashanu for the claimant, Olaniyan, and Kunle Kalejaiye for the defendants. The defendants, including the Assembly speaker, the state House of Assembly; and the clerk, are the first, second and third defendants respectively in the litigation. Twenty four lawmakers had levelled five allegations against the deputy governor, bordering on gross misconduct, abuse of office, financial recklessness, abandonment of office and official duty, as well as insubordination and other offences. The matter first came up before the court on Tuesday, June 28. But the presiding judge had to adjourn the case to the following day, June 29 for hearing because only the counsel of the claimant was present in the court.
