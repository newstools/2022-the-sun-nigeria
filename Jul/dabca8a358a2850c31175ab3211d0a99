From Lateef Dada,  Osogbo  President, FC Ebedei, Barrister Churchill Oliseh has said that challenges facing football development in the country are too numerous and beyond the capability of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). He said the problem would persist until a regulatory structure and framework are properly put in place. Oliseh stated this yesterday in Osogbo, during an interactive session with the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Osun State Chapter in their monthly guest programme tagged “Stakeholders Forum.” The renowned players agent said “you cannot continue to do the same thing the same way and expect a different result. This is why there hasn’t been concrete development in our football sector and why we struggle yo raise a formidable team for the Nation. “The Nigeria football governing body has been treating symptoms of the ailment and not the ailment itself. These problems will perpetually remain at apogee until the NFF takes a holistic look at them, identify these problems and approach them with corresponding solutions. Explaining further, the former International Brewery Limited, Ilesha, first Choice Goalkeeper said many clubs in Nigeria do not have a framework or purpose for their establishment and this is why only the clubs owned and financed by the government thrive. “Nigeria teams lack proper structure. We can’t meet up with the global standard of the way football clubs are managed in Nigeria. In Europe, not all teams are fighting to win trophies and they are making money. The reverse is the case in Nigeria as the focus of most teams is to win the league. When you now look at the amount given to the league winners in Nigeria, it’s far below their expenditure in a season. So, where is the return on Investment here.? What’s now the gain.?  Until this is done, clubs will continue to be having challenges.”
