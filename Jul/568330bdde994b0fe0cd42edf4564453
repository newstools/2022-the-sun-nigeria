One of the most authoritative Italian pundits, Mario Sconcerti has insisted that German Bundesliga champion, Bayern Munich and Premier League giant, Liverpool are not interested in signing Victor Osimhen despite reports linking the Nigeria national teamer with a transfer to both clubs this summer. It was previously claimed that Bayern Munich was plotting a move for Osimhen as a possible replacement for Robert Lewandowski who is angling for a transfer to Barcelona. The Napoli and Super Eagles number 9 was also mentioned as one of the candidates who could fill the void left by Sadio Mane after the Senegal star switched to Bayern Munich. Napoli will reportedly not allow the Nigerian to leave the Diego Maradona Stadium in the summer transfer window for less than one hundred million euros. Sconcerti is of the opinion that Osimhen has not fully developed as a striker but is not ruling out the transfer of the 2015 U17 World Cup Golden Boot winner in the future. “He is still a player to be discovered. But Bayern hasn’t looked for him and neither have Liverpool,” Sconcerti told Calciomercato via Area Napoli. “This means they don’t think he is ready yet. I think Osimhen’s transfer could be next.”
