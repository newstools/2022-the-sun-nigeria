Nollywood diva, Chinwe Isaac, has lamented her challenges playing romantic roles in movies. The actress squealed to Saturday Sun that her lover reacts negatively whenever she plays intimate roles. According to Isaac, she has been compelled to discuss scripts with her man before hitting location. “My boyfriend gets so jealous seeing me play romantic roles in movies. In fact, my man is a jealous lover. He doesn’t like seeing me kiss in movies. And I wouldn’t dare kiss without telling him about the role. I will have to discuss with him and seek his permission. He would have to tell me to go ahead with the role. If the movie eventually comes out, he might even say I over did it. But we laugh over it and it ends well. As a professional, I can play romantic roles but my man gets angry if I don’t discuss it with him first,” she gushed. However, the Painted Lies’ star actress said she would love to marry her colleague, who will give her career a spin to the top. “I would love to marry from my industry. I will accept a suitor who is an actor because I love movie making. Movies have become part of me. Marrying a partner who is in the same industry with me will help a lot. It will make me work harder, keep my marriage and make it smooth. “I think same industry marriage is the best for those who want to stay honest and faithful to their marital vows. I will marry a handsome, God fearing suitor from my industry. I want to stay faithful to my husband.”
