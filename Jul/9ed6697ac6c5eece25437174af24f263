From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja Chieftain of the APC, Osita Okechukwu, has said Bola Tinubu has 60 per cent chance of winning next year’s presidential election. Director-General Voice of Nigeria (VON), who spoke to newsmen in Abuja, said Tinubu enjoyed the latitude of freedom to chose his running mate from the North. He hinged his conviction of Tinubu enjoying 60 per cent chances of winning on the support he would enjoy from APC’s 22 state governors, and majority members of lawmakers at both national and state Assemblies. Okechukwu warned that the South would reject the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, for violating the rotation convention ligament holding the country. Asked if he was not worried about Labour Paryy candidate, Peter Obi’s growing influence, he said: “Obi’s thing is not worrisome, I know the Kwankwaso ailment in NNPP, they have the same ailment with PDP. They don’t believe in rotation convention… “You may not take it serious, but if you know the sense of belonging it brings to north and south you can’t just dismiss it. APC obeyed it. Kwankwaso I know they were afraid of us. I don’t want to name names. This rotation may not have its legal teeth, but it is a convention. It has its own moral angle. That’s why UK does not have a written constitution they live on conventions. Atiku will not know what he did to himself until the day the votes come. So, is also the way Kwankwaso is playing with us.”
