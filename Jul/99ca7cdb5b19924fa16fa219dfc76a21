The global financial digital payment system is set for a seismic shake up. And this revolution is coming from a Nigerian: Peter Alfred-Adekeye. For this Nigerian-born, Paris-based serial tech-disruptor and entrepreneur with an established pedigree for innovation, he is poised to create the first World eco-system for financial digital payment system. Peter recently announced the coming of ‘Boom’, an e-commerce platform where buyer and seller will interface online without a bank account. Announcing the coming of Boom at a parley in Lagos, Peter, a technology visionary, described the platform —launching in Q2 2022— as an integrated e-Commerce marketplace and crypto currency wallet that breaks down geographic and economic barriers. With BOOM, financial inclusion is guaranteed for all by neither enabling everybody to sell online without needing a website nor having to integrate payment processing. In February 2019, Peter launched the Multiven Open Marketplace (MOM), the world’s first blockchain-based, peer-to-peer marketplace for new, pre-owned and re-cycled computer and internet network hardware, software and services. His current venture, Boom, highlights the extraordinary breadth of his interests and aptitudes. Peter prepared to launch the new project, having spent over a decade pondering how Africa’s millions of cellphone-owning but unbanked people can get online, so they can become part of the global economy and improve their life chances. And the answer is Boom. Raised in Lagos by his British-Nigerian Royal Navy veteran father, Peter now calls Paris, Zurich, London and Monaco home, but he is truly a citizen of the world. He has enjoyed an incredible career, from his first startup which exported sustainable teak wood from Nigeria to India in his 20s, to evangelising about technology in Palo Alto, California, to being name-checked on the pages of UK Vogue.
