Enugu State youths have prayed that God would give them mercy to enjoy the successor of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi the way they have enjoyed working harmoniously with the governor. The youths said they would forever remain grateful to Ugwuanyi for giving them the platform to exist in the state as future leaders. Speaking when the Coalition of Enugu State Youths paid solidarity to the Government, House, Enugu, yesterday, Comrade Samuel Ebube Nebo, described the governor as their mentor and leader who has shown them fatherly love and care. Comrade Nebo disclosed that the essence of the visit was to first appreciate the governor and before joining the campaign train of Peter Ndubuisi Mbah, the People Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate endorsed by Ugwuanyi and other PDP candidates in the 2023 general elections. He maintained that Governor Ugwuanyi, who is the PDP candidate for Enugu North Senatorial District, has done so much for the youths of the state. His words: “Your Excellency, we are praying that God in His infinite mercy will give us mercy to enjoy the next governor the way we continue to enjoy you. You are a mentor and a leader. We have these two things to give you. “Your Excellency, you are 58 years and we are here with 58 bottles of water. Igbo people say that water has no enemy and this water will nullify your past, present and future enemies. “Your Excellency, by next year you will be 59 years. We came with another bottle water making it 59. So we are celebrating your birthday this year and we are celebrating next year. And we the youths of Enugu State, pray in all honesty that God will bless you and keep you, more especially, give you peace and long life.”
