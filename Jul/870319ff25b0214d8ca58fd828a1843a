From Agaju Madugba, Katsina The All Progressives Congress (APC) Governors’ Forum rose from a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in his Daura, Katsina State, country home on Monday describing the duo of Ahmed Bola Tinubu and Ibrahim Kashim Shettima as the most formidable team that will ensure victory for the party during the scheduled 2023 presidential polls. “We are quite pleased that this formidable team of Tinubu and Shettima will usher in a new Nigeria in 2023,” the governors said through the forum’s Chairman who is also Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu. Bagudu told reporters, “Kashim Shettima is one of Nigeria’s finest who will bring his wealth of experience to bear in the governance of the nation. “Nigerians should be convinced that this is about the best team from the party for the 2023 general elections. “We are proud and congratulated the President over the development, especially with the manner the primaries held in the most transparent way leading to the emergence of Tinubu as the APC presidential flag bearer. “This team will no doubt compliment the achievements and track records by Buhari in the past seven years, especially with the different policies put in place to bring back the country from the effects of COVID-19 and that of the Russia-Ukraine war. “We have resolved to work hard for the victory of the APC in both the weekend Osun state governorship election and the 2023 general elections.” Some of the other governors who attended the meeting included Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State, Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano, Hope Uzodima of Imo, Ahmed El-Rufai of Kaduna, and Simon Lanlong of Plateau State. Tinubu on Sunday, also in Daura, announced Shettima, a former Governor of Borno State, as his choice of Vice Presidential running mate for the polls, a development that has since engendered mixed reactions from cross-sections of Nigerians.
