From Aloysius Attah, Onitsha   Former Anambra Governor and Labour Party Presidential Candidate for the 2023 general elections, Mr Peter Obi, Founder, Centre for Values in Leadership, Lagos, Prof. Pat Utom, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, School of Politics, Policy and Governance, Abuja, Dr Oby Ezekwesili and the Managing Director, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, will grace the Onitsha Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (ONICCIMA) annual The Perspective Lecture series as resource persons. President of ONICCIMA, Chief Kevin Obieri, who disclosed this yesterday during a press briefing in Onitsha said ONICCIMA is raising the standard and reach of the lecture series this year owing to the fact that the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 lockdown made it impossible for the chamber to host the event in the last two years. Obieri said the lecture theme, ‘In search of Good Governance: The Imperatives of an Organised Private Sector Interface’ remains timely because the sector holds an important pride of place in driving government policies and complementing government efforts in development and industrialisation. Also speaking, Founder of Onitsha Business School, Prof. Segun Sogbesan, who serves as the facilitator for the project said the labelling of Onitsha as a city where nothing good comes from came about as a result of pushing the wrong narratives but expressed delight that the right narrative is now trending where people can now see Onitsha as the centrepiece of the southeast in all sectors. He disclosed that Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, Obi of Onitsha, Nnaemeka Achebe and former governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra state, Chief Valentine Ozigbo who chairs the ceremony have all confirmed their attendance for the event.
