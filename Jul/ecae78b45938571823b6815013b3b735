By Chinelo Obogo The Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) will shut down the 18L and 36R runway of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos from Friday, July 8 to September 5, 2022 to execute critical maintenance works and installation of runway lights. Daily Sun learnt that the decision to close the runway for 60 days was taken at a meeting of the agency and domestic airlines on Tuesday, July 5, at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport conference room. Although the domestic operators had proposed that the date be shifted to enable them adjust their schedules due to the sallah celebrations, FAAN insisted the date has been decided and that there was no going back on the issue. The airlines had complained about issues bordering on increased taxi time for all departures and arrivals into Lagos, increased fuel usage due to the long taxing to and from 18R and flight schedule upward adjustment because of the increased turn-around time. But FAAN in collaboration with Traffic Controllers was said to have promised to make the exercise seamless within the period by providing the procedural flow and NOTAM for the exercise.
