The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Kano State Command has cautioned motorists to drive with utmost care to avoid road traffic crash, especially during the rainy season. The Sector Commander, CC Zubairu Mato, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Kano. He said drivers should buy good tyres, check their wipers, trafficators and other lightening systems of their vehicles to ensure they were in good condition. According to him, “when the rain is heavy, the roads are very slippery and visibility is dull. “Motorists need to drive between 20 kilometres to 30 kilometres on highway while 10 kilometres to 20 kilometres in built up areas so as to avoid road traffic crash, ” he said. Mato urged motorists to be mindful of potholes and pedestrians crossing the roads. He further explained that FRSC would go round motor parks and sensitise commercial drivers to desist from excessive speeding and dangerous driving on highways to avert road traffic mishap.” The sector commander added that the command would always continue to participate in filling of potholes on highways as part of its community development service, with the assistance of construction companies to avert road accidents.
