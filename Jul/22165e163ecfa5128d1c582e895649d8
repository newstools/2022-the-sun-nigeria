By Emma Jemegah The six-year journey to the Nigeria Professional Football League title for Rivers United had the backing of West Africa’s largest independent chemical as well as oil and gas engineering solutions provider, Eunisell. For Rivers United, it has been a six-year journey, but seven years for the Eunisell brand as a sponsor in the Nigeria Professional Football League. Indeed, today’s marriage between Eunisell and Rivers United kicked off with Sharks Football Club, now defunct, on Tuesday, July 21, 2015. At the event, Group Managing Director of Eunisell, Chika Ikenga, revealed that the sponsorship was not just to benefit the club alone, but to also raise consciousness for brands to show interest in the NPFL. In February 2016, Governor Nyesom Wike, of Rivers State, decided to merge relegated Sharks and Dolphins, also owned by the State. The decision produced a new team, Rivers United and Eunisell remained as sponsor of the new team. For Eunisell, sponsoring Rivers United is a strategy to be part of their history and ultimate success. This success was eventually achieved as the club emerged Nigerian champions for the first time this season.
