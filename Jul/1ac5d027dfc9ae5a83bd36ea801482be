Southampton are in advanced talks to sign Rangers midfielder Joe Aribo.  A deal is close to being agreed and the fee is believed to be worth £10m including add-ons. It is understood the 25-year-old, who has a £10m release clause in his contract, is open to the move to St Mary’s. The Nigerian international has one year left on his deal at Ibrox, having moved to Glasgow in the summer of 2019 from Charlton Athletic. He scored nine goals, including one in the Europa League final, in 57 games last season and added 10 assists. The Ibrox side have so far only added defender John Souttar to the squad this summer, while striker Alfredo Morelos and Ryan Kent are also in the final years of their current Ibrox deals. Joe Aribo impressed for Rangers last season and it was no surprise he was one of the most used players in the squad. His versatility was a benefit to Giovanni van Bronckhorst as the manager dealt with a number of injuries. Aribo played in central midfield, attacking midfield, down the right and ended the season playing up front.
