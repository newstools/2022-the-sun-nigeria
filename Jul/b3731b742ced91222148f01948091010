By Chinelo Obogo, Lagos The National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE) has condemned the non-resolution of the dispute between the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the federal government which has led to the over four-month closure of universities. In a statement signed by the Deputy General Secretary, Umoh Ofonime, the association said it supports the position of the National Executive Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to embark on a nationwide protest on July 26 and 27, 2022 in solidarity with the trade unions in the Nigeria Public Universities and others. The association directed all branch chairmen/secretaries in their various branches to participate in the solidarity protest in their various states. We have observed with regret how the Federal Government of Nigeria is treating the crises in the educational sector of the country whereby due to strikes, students have remained at home for over four months. “The refusal of the federal government to honour the agreement signed with the union since 2009 is very disturbing considering the negative impact the prolonged strike will create in the life of these children. “By this, the National Administrative Council has directed all branch chairmen/secretaries are requested to disseminate this information to all the members in their various branches to participate in the solidarity protest in their various states as follows: Tuesday 26, July 2022 and Wednesday 27, July 2022. Venue: All the state capitals of the federation and Abuja, the federal capital. Take off Point: NLC State Secretariats and the Labour House, Abuja,” Ofonime said.
