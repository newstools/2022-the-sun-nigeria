From Kenneth Udeh Exhibition of empathy by the Senator representing Anambra Central Senatorial District, Uche Ekwunife, has been identified as one of the major factors that have motivated her performance as a lawmaker since her election in 2019. Ekwunife, who is seeking re-election on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), said that since her election, her huge investments in the facilitation of infrastructure, jobs and educational grants in her constituency set her apart from her fellow con- tenders. Adding that representation must be measured by impact, stressing the need for discipline and accountability among public officers. Ekwunife made this known yesterday, during her periodic interactive radio session with constituents on Ogene 98.3 FM Enugwu-Ukwu in Anambra state. Speaking on the one hour programme, the Senator said that the measure of representation should be based on the impact such representation has had on the people. “Representation is about service. When I was elected to represent the good people of Anambra Central Senatorial District in 2019, I promised to be a strong voice in the Senate as well as attract meaningful development to the zone. From day one, I showed strong commitment towards achieving my goals in office and I’m glad that today we’ve been able to make a meaningful impact on the lives of our people,” the grassroots-friendly lawmaker said.
