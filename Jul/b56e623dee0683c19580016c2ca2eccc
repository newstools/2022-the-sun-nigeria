From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said it was sure of winning the July 16 governorship poll. The acting National Chairman, Umar Damagun, stated this, yesterday, in Abuja, while receiving report of the reconciliation panel on the Osun State chapter of the party. He said Nigerians have allegedly rejected the All Progressives Congress (APC). Damagun, while expressing appreciation to the panel, headed by former PDP governorship candidate in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede, said the report will help in addressing the wrangling in other state chapters of the opposition party. “We are sure of victory. We are just waiting for July 16 and it is part of your contribution, in terms of this reconciliation. However, we still want to enjoin you, even though, there is no Lagos, part of your assignment is Osun and Lagos. “I want you to take this opportunity, like you did in Osun, to hit the ground in even Lagos too. Apart from the fact that we don’t have election there now, we have ample time to go to Lagos and make sure what you did in Osun, you did the same.   “We hope your report will go a long way, not only in Osun, but also in other state chapters. I believe this is the type of expectations that we want members of various committees that have been saddled with various assignments from this National Working Committee,” the party chairman said. Similarly, the PDP National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu, in his vote of thanks, said the party’s victory in Osun and Lagos states would be crucial to its quest to take over the South West.
