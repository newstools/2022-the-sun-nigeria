From David Onwuchekwa, Nnewi A native doctor, Ovamba Onyeachonam, has called on the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate for the 2023 election, Bola Tinubu and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) counterpart, Atiku Abubakar to quit the race because of their age. Onyeachonam made the call in his Nando country home, Anambra East Local Government Area of Anambra State. He said they cannot cheat nature and should allow a younger person, like the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi, as a youth to take up the leadership of Nigeria. “The major problem of this country is that the old refuse to handover leadership to the youths who are sound physically and mentally. “They should give way to the likes of Obi. Why must the aged continue to rule when they have capable sons who obviously will do better than them. “That is why we say Nigerian politicians are rotten. Old politicians should not continue to occupy elective positions and I believe this time around the youths want a change.” He warned that any attempt to deny Obi the presidential seat by way of rigging would result in serious political crisis, adding that the youths would then show that power belongs to them.

It may come by way of revolution and it will be unstoppable. “Nigerians are tired of old politicians, it is the likes of Obi that will stop the incessant killings, kidnapping, armed robbery, terrorism and banditry,” he said. Onyeachonam said he believed Obi would not discriminate against other tribes when elected as the country is a circular nation.
