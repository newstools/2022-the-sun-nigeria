According to the report coming from South Africa, European clubs are jostling for the services of Nigeria’s Super Eagles goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi, BSNsports.com.ng has gathered. The former Warri Wolves goalkeeper was released at the end of the just concluded season by Kaizer Chief after spending close to 2 years with the team. Club in the South Africa Premier League have signified interest in his services but nothing concrete has materialised. Despite the European team’s keen to have him, Akpeyi still want to remain in South Africa for family reasons. “There has been interest in Daniel Akpeyi from abroad from at least two clubs who have been keen to sign him. But the player’s focus has been on his family that he needs to settle (in Mzansi) and that’s why he has taken his time in deciding on a potential PSL move, otherwise, he could have signed for one of those clubs (from abroad),” the report said. In the meantime, the veteran shot-stopper has been training on his own under the watchful eye of his countryman, Greg Etafia.
