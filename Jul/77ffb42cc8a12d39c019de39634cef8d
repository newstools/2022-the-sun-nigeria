From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has applauded the recent decision of the United Nations(UN) through its UN Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention urging the Nigeria government to release the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu under the custody of the Department of State Service(DSS). IPOB in a statement released by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful has equally enjoined the Federal government to obey the decision of the UN and release Kanu unconditionally. The UN in their decision had faulted the rendition of Kanu and ordered he should be equally compensated. While particularly commending Attorney Bruce Fein in regards to the recently issued United Nations Opinion and his professional conducts Powerful noted that it is a landmark victory for “Kanu,IPOB and Biafrans worldwide”. He said “In the same vein, we commend all those who quietly labored and assisted in achieving this landmark victory. It is indeed a great milestone for our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, the IPOB and Biafrans worldwide. “We also express our profound gratitude to the United Nations and its Working Group for their courage in reaching this decision and issuing an opinion that comports with the tenets of international laws. “It is our hope that Nigeria, as a member of the United Nations, will take heed and promptly obey and implement the UN directives to the letter. We caution that this is not a Nigerian court order that is often disobeyed without consequences”. Powerful stated.
