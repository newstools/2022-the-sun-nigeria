After an impactful two-year music course, the Musical Society of Nigeria (MUSON) in partnership with MTN Foundation, on Tuesday July 5, 2022 graduated 29 outstanding music scholars. Speaking at the ceremony, Executive Secretary, MTN Foundation, Odunayo Sanya, said the NGO is dedicated to fostering and celebrating local talent in collaboration with organisations that share its beliefs. “The role that the arts play for individuals and in society is a pivotal one, and we are humbled to present this new cohort of music professionals. The MUSON Diploma course was chosen by the MTN Foundation as one of its youth development programmes, and with our shared commitment to quality over the last 15 years, the MTNF remains firm in its commitment to elevate the arts through the MTN MUSON partnership,” she stated. In his remark, the chairman of MUSON, Louis Mbanefo said, “It’s with great joy and delight that we are graduating a new set of music scholars. However, I must acknowledge you not to fall into the Nigerian idea of success. Music is important, therefore, continue to practice and hone your skills. Continue to learn more about composers and raise the bar of excellence. The future of MUSON depends on you and your performance, and we will continue to show gratitude. To our major sponsor, MTN Foundation, we are grateful for your continued support.”   The MTN/MUSON Music Scholars programme is an initiative that seeks to provide support to musically inclined Nigerian youths. Since 2006, the MTN MUSON partnership has produced over 400 music scholars. MTNF has invested about N740m in the programme through scholarship awards, installation of a fully equipped digital studio, donation of laptops and other musical equipment.
