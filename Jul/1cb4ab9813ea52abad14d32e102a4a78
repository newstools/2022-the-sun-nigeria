Actress and filmmaker, Titilola Ajayi, is back on the set of her anticipated movie titled, Aimokan. The talented role interpreter, who is gradually rising in Nollywood, noted that the movie would reveal how women abuse men emotionally. “My new film is on emotional abuse. While abuse of women is widely known, what is not widely recognized is that men can be victims of emotional abuse too. It’s unfortunate but true that women and men can be emotionally abusive towards men as they can be towards women. Often times, we hear about cases of domestic violence, which is usually centered on a man beating a woman. Women can be toxic too and no one seems to be talking about this other side of abuse. We claim we love our men but some women make their men face emotional abuse. When men have pent up emotions, it affects their work life, family life and other parts of their life. Trust is vital in any relationship, so women should learn to love calmly without being obsessed,” she told Saturday Sun Asked what people should look forward to in Aimokan, Ajayi said: “People should look out for Titilola in another dimension. This is me giving out my best. I want them to look forward to an amazing excellent production, something different from the norm.” The flick will feature Ibrahim Chatta, Bimbo Oshin, Kolawole Ajeyemi, Tokunbo Awoga, Yetunde Bakare, and other talented actors.
