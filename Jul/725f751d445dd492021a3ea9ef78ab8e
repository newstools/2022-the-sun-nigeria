By Bimbola Oyesola The Maritime Workers Union (MWUN) have threatened to commence three days warning strike nationwide at the expiration of its ongoing three days strike notice on Friday. President of the union, Adewale Adeyanju in a letter to the Managing Director, Nigerian Ports Authority, warned that the union might not be able to pacify its members who have grown restive, and poised for an action. Expressing disappointment at the refusal of the APMT management to conclude negotiations with the union, Adeyanju said the union has extended the strike notice by another three days effective July 18 to 21 to conclude all negotiations, otherwise it would escalate to full blown strike. “Consequent to the above, I am directed to notify you that Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria shall in the event of APMT management’s refusal to conclude negotiation at the expiration of the extended three notice, embark on a three day warning strike, strictly in APMT terminals.” He stated that the union was constrained to report the persistent refusal of the APMT management to conclude Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiation with the union – Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, in spite of concerted efforts to bring negotiations to closure. “Sir, we want to say that Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) has held over four meetings with APMT management all of which ended inconclusive due to the recalcitrant posture of APMT management.”  He explained that the union having exhausted all available means of negotiation had issued APMT management, a seven-day ultimatum which had also elapsed.
