Ex-Nigeria captain, Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha has warned that fans should lower their expectations on the Super Eagles because the team is rebuilding after the failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. The Super Eagles failed to qualify for this year’s World Cup when they lost out to perennial rivals Ghana in March. That was after they crashed out in the second round of the delayed 2021 AFCON in Cameroon earlier this year. Portuguese coach, Jose Peseiro has since been appointed to rebuild the team. The team currently tops Group A of the 2023 AFCON qualifiers with six points from two matches.  “We have to accept our fate. We have a new manager in place,” Okocha said.  “It’s like a fresh start and maybe we have to reduce our expectations (on the Super Eagles) at the moment and accept where we are that we have a lot of work to do and encourage them to try and get us there.” Okocha was part of the ‘Golden Generation’ of Nigeria football in the 90s during which Nigeria won the 1994 AFCON, 1996 Olympic gold and got to the knockout rounds of the 1994 World Cup on their debut appearance.
