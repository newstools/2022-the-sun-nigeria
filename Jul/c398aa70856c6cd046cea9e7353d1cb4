By Monica Iheakam The Athletics Integrity Unit has commended Nigeria for an improved domestic testing of athletes prior to major international competitions. Nigeria is among the seven Category A countries identified by the AIU for the year 2022 in view. In a release on their website, 25 athletes from Nigeria were among the 156 athletes from six other countries that were entered for the World championships holding in Eugene, Oregon, USA. Chairman of the AIU Board, David Howman praised Nigeria for the concerted efforts put in place in tackling doping among athletes. “Therefore, it is very pleasing to see the significant improvements in most ‘Category A’ countries thanks to this rule. I particularly commend the Nigerian team. It is amasing what can be achieved when the domestic authorities start taking anti-doping seriously.
