By Tosin Ajirire The Big Brother Naija is back with palpable excitement as the Season 7 of the reality show began yesterday with 12 housemates. With theme: ‘Level Up’, this season, like that of last year, is a double-launch edition, witnessing some housemates entering the Big Brother House on Saturday while the rest will be admitted today. All the housemates will battle for a grand prize worth N100 million. The housemates that came into the house yesterday included Groovy, Beauty, Kess, Daniella, Amaka, Pharmsavi, Ilebaye, Bryann, Cyph,  Phyna, Khalid and Christy O. However, the premiere night was not without music, as it featured electrifying performances from Asake and Victony, who thrilled the live audience with their hit songs. Fans of the show will love this season because several pre-COVID-19 elements are returning to the game, such as the Ninjas and live studio audience. Also expected is a line-up of more engaging tasks, unpredictable twists and Big Brother’s wits. Organised by MultiChoice Nigeria and hosted by Ebuka Obi-Echendu, the Africa’s biggest reality show will run for 72 days of what promises to be dramatic, insightful and downright entertaining. Sponsored by PiggyVest (formerly Abeg) and associate sponsored by Flutterwave, viewers should expect to experience talented youngsters, bellyaching laughs, emotional moments and candid advice.
