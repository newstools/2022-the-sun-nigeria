From Tony John, Port Harcourt    Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has tasked commissioners, heads of ministries, departments and agencies to begin compilation of relevant information required to document the successes of the administration from 2015, when his administration started. Governor Wike stated that he was determined to do a proper handover to his successor despite the fact that his predecessor did not do a proper handover to him. He gave the charge after swearing in five new commissioners yesterday, at the Executive Chamber of the Government House in Port Harcourt. The commissioners sworn-in include Deinma Iyalla, assigned to the Ministry of Special Projects; Prof. Prince Chinedu Mmom,  Ministry of Education; Boma Iyaye, Ministry of Local Government Affairs; Christopher Green Ministry of Sports and Burabe Anea-Bari Donald posted to the Ministry of Chieftaincy and Community Affairs. Governor Wike informed that his administration was in its last lap and there was a need for the different ministries to begin compiling records of their activities in lieu of handing over day. “Everybody should as a matter of fact, put the records of their various ministries together. You won’t wait till May 29, 2023. You have to start now since this administration started in 2015. State what we have done, and by the grace of God, when the new person (governor) comes, he will have a handover note, and it will not be like me who didn’t get a handover note. “Everything we have done, all the records. What we have bought from ministry to ministry, you have to start compiling them. I don’t want to hear a situation where you will say, ‘there is no time.’ There is plenty of time. You don’t need to wait till the last day. That is why things are difficult for some people.”
