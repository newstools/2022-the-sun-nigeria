From George Onyejiuwa,Owerri Palpable anxiety has enveloped the Umuoma Nekede community in Owerri West Council of Imo State, following the abduction of a businessman by gunmen. It was learnt that the victim, identified as Umunna Onyeokwu, a native of Umuikea, Umuoma, was said to be inside his car parked within his family compound when three armed men swooped on him, dragged him out of his car, and whisked him  away with their vehicle. Daily Sun reliably gathered from a native of the community yesterday, that the ugly incident, which happened last Sunday evening, has thrown the entire community into fear and panic. A community source, who pleaded anonymity, said Umunna, who is a Lagos-based businessman, just returned to the village last week and, on  Sunday evening, he had gone to play football at the Central Primary School, not knowing that he was being trailed by his abductors. He continued: “So, when he parked his car near his house and was trying to get out of the car, the men immediately walked towards him and pointed a gun at him, ordered him into their car and zoomed off.” It was also learnt that his abductors were yet to contact his family. A source close to the family said: “We have not made contact with the abductors. We are pleading for his release. “We are dumbfounded because such a thing has not happened in our community before. We have not heard or seen abductors coming into a compound to kidnap people before.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video This is a modal window.
