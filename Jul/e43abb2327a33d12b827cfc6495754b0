From Fred Ezeh, Abuja Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has announced an introduction of fee (token) for candidates that would participate in subsequent mock Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) starting with 2023. JAMB Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, in 2017 introduced mock examination, made it free for candidates, to perhaps, enable them get acquainted with the Computer Based Test (CBT), conquer fear and anxiety, and stand a better chance of improved performance in the examination. Candidates who are interested in the mock examination are always advised to indicate interest during registration so they can be considered and assigned to a CBT centre to participate in the exercise on a scheduled date. Prof. Oloyede, during his presentation at the 2022 Policy Meeting held in Abuja, on Thursday, said they have observed that many candidates never turn up for the mock examination on the scheduled date for reasons best known to them. He said: “We have observed that many candidates decide to boycott the mock examination, thereby disrupting our plans. 250 computers are approved for each accredited CBT centre. So, when we allocate candidates to these CBT centres and they don’t show up, we loose because we pay the CBT centres for the 250 spaces. “Going forward, candidates who wish to participate in the mock examination would have to pay a token on the day of the examination to the CBT centres. This may make them be more serious with the examination.” Prof. Oloyede, however, confirmed that there was improvement in the 2022 UTME exercise indicating a slight departure from previous exercises, perhaps, because of increased effort by JAMB officials and stakeholders to strengthen its systems and personnel. He assured that subsequent UTME exercises would record improvement with the dedication and commitment of personnel, vendors and other relevant stakeholders including heads of tertiary institutions.
