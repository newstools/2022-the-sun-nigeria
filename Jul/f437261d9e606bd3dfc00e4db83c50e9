Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen risks jail term following an order of arrest dished out by an Ikeja High Court in Nigeria. It was gathered that the lanky striker has severally disobeyed the court orders for him to appear before it, and state his own part of the story in the allegation leveled against him by his in-law and ex-agent Osita Okolo. The allegation is said to have bothered on commissions from his move to Napoli. As first reported by own goal.com, Okolo was part of the team behind Osimhen’s move to Napoli for a fee of around Seventy One Million Euro, but that amount is currently being disputed by an investigation into the deal by the Italian and French authorities. It was further gathered that William D’Avilla who was the main act in brokering the deal was due a commission of Five Million Euro from which he will pay Osita one million euro. D’ Avilla paid Osita $450k and another $91k. According to what was gathered, Osimhen collected the money paid to Osita saying he wants to use it to settle other family members and will return the cash to his in-law when he is settled in Italy. Report has it that the soccer star didn’t return the cash as promised and in November, Osita went public with it in an interview where he said that the 23 year old should take care of his family members. That didn’t go down well with Osimhen who text him to say he won’t have him as his agent anymore.
