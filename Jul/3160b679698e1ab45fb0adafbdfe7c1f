Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, has urged electorate in Osun to vote massively for incumbent Governor Gboyega Oyetola to continue the good work he is doing. The former two-term governor of Abia State also charged all security agencies to synergize with each other and make sure the state witnessed a peaceful and incident-free election. The statement he issued last night read: “The Osun governorship election is a few days away and I am happy our party, the All Progressive Congress (APC), is not just out to participate but to win the election. “Osun election is a very important one for the party as it serves as forerunner for the 2023 general election. Our victory in Osun will be a victory sign for 2023. This is the reason the party must close ranks to win massively. “Governor Gboyega Oyetola has also done well in the three and half years he has governed the state . It is expected that Osun people will re-elect him so as to consolidate his achievements and improve on what he is doing. “Despite my unavoidable absence in the campaigns due to my trip to Germany, I strongly believe that the party will come out victorious. “I urge all security agencies to synergize with each other and make sure Osun witnesses a peaceful and incident-free election.”
