French champion, Paris Saint-Germain has joined La Liga giant, Barcelona in the race for Aston Villa youngster, Carney Chukwuemeka, according to a report by The Mirror. Chukwuemeka made his breakthrough last season, featuring in 12 Premier League appearances for the Villans under Steven Gerrard. The 18-year-old was expected to get more playing time next season under the former Rangers boss, but things have become complicated recently. With a year left on Chukwuemeka’s deal, Villa wants the England youth international to commit to a new long-term contract. But the Austria-born midfielder is asking for guarantees on playing time and a £100,000-a-week salary before inking a new deal, says The Mirror. Villa is open to letting the starlet depart the Villa Park and will likely demand £20m from any interested suitor. Barcelona and Newcastle United have been linked to a move for Chukwuemeka, but no club has made an offer for him. PSG’s interest may, however, change the dynamics for the midfielder who captained England at the Under-19s level and was part of UEFA’s Team of the Tournament at the recent European Under-19 Championships in Slovakia. While hoping Chukwuemeka has a change of heart and signs the dotted line in the Midlands, Steven Gerard left out the teen wonder from the Villa squad on tour of Australia. Chukwuemeka remains eligible to play for the national teams of England, Nigeria, and Austria.
