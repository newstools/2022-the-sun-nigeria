From Gyang Bere, Jos Former member of the House of the Representatives and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),  Bitrus Kaze, has said it would be morally wrong to work for the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar when it is the turn of the South to produce the president in 2023. He explained that he would work for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, who has all it takes to drive the nation’s economy to success and restore dignity in the country. During an interview with journalists in Jos, Kaze said it was morally wrong for Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim, to be president for eight years and for another Muslim to succeed him. He lamented that the mistake of the PDP which threw the presidency open was what gave rise to the third force, the Labour Party, where most Nigerians, particularly youths have aligned with. “That somebody from the North West would be president for eight years, you expect somebody from the North East, same religion like the outgoing, to be there for another eight years; it would be a betrayal of trust for me to commit myself to such a project on the Plateau, I will not. “As a person, I’m at home with Peter Obi, and this I will suggest to our people to vote for him, because his candidature pronounces justice, he carries every section of this country, I’m not afraid to say it, I’m prepared to say it anywhere.” Kaze, who represented Jos South/Jos East Federal Constituency between 2007 to 2015, added: “If the PDP is able to take the ticket from the North and give anybody from the South, I will support that person. But to the extent that the PDP has infringed its own constitution, I will remain faithful to the constitution of the party by supporting anybody from Southern Nigeria, and the closest is Peter Obi.”
