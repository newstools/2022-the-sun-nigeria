Mr Emmanuel Ogidi, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says the party is focused on rescuing Nigeria from its security and economic challenges. Ogidi, a former National Vice Chairman of the PDP, South-South, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Abuja. He noted that PDP members were more than ever determined to rescue Nigeria from her current predicament. The party chieftain assured that members dissatisfied with the outcome of the recent party primaries would not defect from the party, “as PDP is the only vehicle to achieve that dream”. Ogidi said that Gov. Nyesom Wike of Rivers, Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue, former Gov. Ayo Fayose of Ekiti, among others, who had variously voiced out their dissatisfaction would remain in the party. According to him, PDP, being one big family, has the internal mechanism to deal with any dissatisfaction. “We will deal with it, it is nothing big. We have seen all these types of crises in the party before,” he said Ogidi dismissed as untrue, rumours making the rounds that there was a plot to remove the National Chairman of the party, Sen. Iyorchia Ayu. The party stalwart described such rumours as the handiwork of the enemies of the main opposition party in the country. He said that the time to share power across the six geopolitical zones had not yet come, saying “such discussions are done after victory at the polls”. (NAN)
