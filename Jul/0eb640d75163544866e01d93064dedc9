Former Rangers manager Stuart McCall has picked the player he would love to keep at the Light Blues next season. Three of the Gers’ players Alfredo Morelos, Ryan Kent and Joe Aribo have all entered into the final year of their existing contract with the club. If contract extensions cannot be agreed upon by the parties, the Rangers hierarchy must either opt to cash in on the players this summer or risk losing them for free next summer when their contracts with the club expire. McCall picked Ryan Kent as the player he would like to keep at the club ahead of Alfredo Morelos and Joe Aribo. McCall said to Daily Record : “I’d say there are more centre forwards out there than guys who can go and really open up a game the way Kent can. He’s such an exciting talent when games are tight. He’s a player you look to and think he can make something happen. “As good as Morelos has been, I’d think I’d choose Kent because he’s a match-winner. As for Aribo, he’s a fantastic talent but he’s just played 70 games last season for club and country. “That’s my worry – the burnout factor. He had a purple patch at the start of the season where he was just fantastic. But for me, he just hasn’t kicked on since coming back from the AFCON.” Aribo enjoyed cup glory with Rangers in 2021-2022, helping them win the Scottish Cup last month but couldn’t help the club to retain the league title whilst losing the Europa League final to Eintracht Frankfurt. The lanky midfielder also became only the second Nigerian player to score in the final of a European competition after ex-Arsenal star Alex Iwobi.
