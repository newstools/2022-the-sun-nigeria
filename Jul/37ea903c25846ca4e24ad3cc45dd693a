After its debut on July 1, the reunion edition of Showmax’s Real Housewives of Lagos continues to air on Friday July 8, 2022. Real Housewives of Lagos follows the opulent lives of six of the most glamorous women in Lagos. They include Carolyna Hutchings, Laura Ikeji-Kanu, Chioma Ikokwu, Toyin Lawani-Adebayo, Iyabo Ojo, and Mariam Timmer. The show has been entertaining and explosive with its hashtag: #RHOLagos making a constant trend on Twitter. The first episode of the show also broke the record for the most first-day views on Showmax Nigeria. Two notable explosive moments from the season occurred during the fight between Laura and Carolyna, and the brouhaha between Chioma and Carolyna. The latter was one the audience did not see coming, as both women had been best of friends until that moment. There was also the off-camera fight between Carolyna and Iyabo that left fans with lots of questions. Hosted by media personality, Uti Nwachukwu, Real Housewives of Lagos reunion will see all six ladies sit down to speak to issues that occurred on the show, and situations that equally happened off the cameras, with the anchor moderating the session and digging for all the juicy details.
