Napoli is yet to receive any official offers for Victor Osimhen even as the club confirms that several clubs have shown interest in the Nigerian international.

We’ve received many calls, but not offers,” Giuntoli said at a press conference on Saturday. Napoli rejected a €100m bid from Newcastle in January and the player is reportedly unwilling to sign with a club that doesn’t play Champions League football next season.
