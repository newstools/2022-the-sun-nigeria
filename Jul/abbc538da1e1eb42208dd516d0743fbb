By Monica Iheakam Nigeria’s sprint hurdler, Tobi Amusan is banking on God’s grace as she warms up for the finals of the hurdles event today at the World Athletics Championship ending today in Eugene, Oregon. Amusan, in a superlative form, set a new African record on Saturday in Oregon as she won heat 3 of women’s 100m Hurdles with a time of 12.40s (+1.5). While this is her third straight semifinal in World Athletics Championships history, Amusan says she will be more fulfilled winning a medal this time. Amusan, who was fourth three years ago in Doha, is seeking to become the second Nigerian sprint hurdler to win a medal at the Championships after Glory Alozie, who won a silver medal in Seville, Spain in 1999. After her race on Saturday, Amusan on her Facebook page wrote: “God is working His purpose out. 12.42s—>12.41s—>12.40s. “Glad to have broken the African Record THREE times.  I don’t know why it’s coming by 0.01s each time. I am trusting God through the rounds! ” “This is my 3rd appearance at the World Champs. I was a semifinalist in London 2017, finished 4th in Doha 2019 and by God’s grace I will be on the podium this year ”. While this is Amusan’s third straight semifinal in World Athletics Championships history, she would be more fulfilled winning a medal this time.
