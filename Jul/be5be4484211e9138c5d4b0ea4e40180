Italian football pundit Michele Plastino believes Osimhen is the perfect fit for Napoli and the most significant piece in manager Luciano Spalletti’s tactical construct. Osimhen’s stay in Naples beyond this summer is still not guaranteed with several English Premier League and German Bundesliga clubs interested in his services. Despite reportedly receiving offers from Arsenal and Manchester United, Napoli have still not parted ways with their Nigerian import. Bayern Munich could still test Il Partenopei’s resolve with a multi million-euro bid in the coming days. A deal for Osimhen could be set in motion as soon as Barcelona completes the signing of the Polish international. In the event of an Osimhen departure, Napoli can replace him with Sassuolo’s exciting striker Gianluca Scamacca or Lille’s lively lad Jonathan David. 23-year-old Scamacca netted 16 Serie A goals last term, two more than Osimhen, having played nine league games more than the Nigerian. 22-year-old David, who replaced Osimhen at Lille, managed 15 Ligue 1 goals in 38 matches. The Italian and Canadian forwards are two of Europe’s most courted youngsters in the transfer market. Despite Napoli looking well-covered should they sanction the exit of Osimhen, Plastino remains convinced that the Neapolitans already have their ideal frontman in the Super Eagles striker. When asked who he would go for between Lille’s David and Sassuolo’s Scamacca to replace Osimhen, Plastino insists only Osimhen can fire Napoli to glory next season. “For me the best striker for Napoli is Victor Osimhen,” the football pundit told Radio Sportiva, as per Tutto Napoli. “The Nigerian, in addition to being very strong, has integrated well into the squad of the Azzurri and, consequently, I am convinced he can do very well in the next football season.”
