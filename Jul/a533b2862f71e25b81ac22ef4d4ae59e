By Lawrence Enyoghasu Nigeria’s first inter-dealer brokers, Parthian Partners Limited, has celebrated 10 years of operations as they boast of being the first broker in Nigeria to successfully issue and redeem a N20Billion (NGN) Commercial Paper on the FMDQ Exchange. Speaking at the event, Chairman of Parthian Group, Mr Adedotun Sulaiman, said that the company came into existence at a time when the concept interdealer or intermediary was alien to the region, “so we had to build from scratch. Today we are celebrating all those who have contributed to the success of Parthian and the industry in general. For us, success was achievable because we had a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve, and we were focused on making it work. It was no mean feat to introduce this vision and work with regulators and develop a framework for its regulation and operations. A vision which birthed not only a successful business but also a thriving sector.” Also, Chief Executive Officer of Parthian Partners, Mr Oluseye Olusoga, said the company has greatly contributed to bridging the gap in both the wholesale and retail financial sector. He said, “The wholesale brokerage industry is one with huge potentials though when we decided to set up the first ever interdealer brokerage business in Nigeria, there was no regulatory framework, the industry didn’t even exist. Now, there are so many other businesses in Nigeria who do what we do.”  Olusoga stated. The event featured an outstanding performance from one of Africa’s prominent artistes, Wande Coal and beautiful rendition from Esther who is the recent winner of the Voice Nigeria.
