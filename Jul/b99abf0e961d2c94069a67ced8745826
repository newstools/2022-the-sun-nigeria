By Christopher Oji  The Lagos State Police Command has uncovered plans by suspected cult groups in the state to celebrate the 777 yearly commemoration in the state today. The police, in a statement by state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO ), Benjamin Hundeyin, particularly mentioned the 777 Neo Black Movement or Africa (a.k.a Black Axe Day). Hundeyin, in the statement, yesterday, said: “Credible intelligence at the disposal of the Lagos State Police Command reveals that some hoodlums and cultists have perfected plans to celebrate what they call “7/7 Neo Black Movement of Africa, aka Black Axe Day”, on Thursday, July 7, 2022. “In view of this, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, in very strong terms, warns these groups with intent to scuttle the peace being enjoyed in the State, to shelve their plans. “Consequently, the Command’s tactical teams, Area Commanders and DPOs, in collaboration with other sister agencies, are fully prepared to clamp down heavily on organisers, leaders and progenitors of such sinister groups, whose aim is to cause wanton violence in the State. “The Command is, therefore, using this medium to appeal to parents and guardians to warn their children/wards to steer clear of any unlawful gathering or society before, during and after the said date. “Also, hoteliers are, by this release, warned not to allow their facilities to be used for any cult-related gathering, as owners of such facilities will be liable to prosecutions.” The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, while urging all residents of the  state, to be law abiding and vigilant, enjoined them to go about lawful duties without fear of harassment or intimidation.
