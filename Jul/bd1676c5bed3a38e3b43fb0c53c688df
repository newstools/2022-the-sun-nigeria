Mohammed Oluwaseyi Alli and Abbas Oluwatoyin Alli aka Tanzyl have released a six-track album titled, Xai. According to the siblings, “Xai means revelation and revelations are made manifest in different ways, but one thing is for sure, once a revelation is revealed, something powerful has been unveiled, which makes our story unique.”Other tracks in the album include Iyawo, You, I wish, Forever, Beast in Me, and Wider Wider. However, one of the tracks, Iyawo, being the main song, was chosen because of its relevance and cultural character. It also dwells on the marriage practices of the Yoruba. Tanzyl, who are indigenes of Ilesha, Osun State, were born and raised in Plateau State. They attended Women Association Nursery School, Jos University Primary School and Demonstration Secondary School. They both graduated from University of Jos.“We developed a fondness for music early in life, which blossomed into a passion, and it was only a matter of time before we embraced music professionally. After school, we relocated to Lagos in a bid to further our music careers. Lagos is the entertainment capital of Africa and a hub for creatives from all walks of life to connect and create, and we are poised to play our parts in this musical revolution that has taken over Africa and the world,” they chorused.
