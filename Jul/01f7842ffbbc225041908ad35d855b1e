Wife of Enugu State governor, Mrs. Monica Ugwuanyi, on Wednesday, donated artificial arms and limbs to 80 amputees in Enugu. Ugwuanyi, who made the donation in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, said that the gesture would “help the recipients to live normal lives”. She advised the recipients against street begging, pointing out that they were “as normal as other human beings, with the artificial arms and limbs”. Ugwuanyi urged the recipients to seek self-employments skills as there were no  enough white collar jobs in Nigeria. “If you become self-employed, you will reduce poverty in your families,” she said. Ugwuanyi promised to mobilise better packages that would support the amputees to improve their living standards, and cautioned them feeling disadvantaged in any way. In a remark, the Commissioner for Health, Dr Sam Ngwu, commended Ugwuanyi for her support to the needy, and expressed the ministry readiness to support her efforts toward a better life for the less privilege. Ngwu, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Mr Sylvester Ugwuabgo, particularly thanked Ugwuanyi for reaching out to the rural dwellers in the area of healthcare. Mrs. Joy Ani, one of the recipients, thanked the governor’s wife for the gesture, saying that she was feeling and looking normal. “I feel as normal as everyone in my community; I feel well encouraged to be self-employed and will use whatever is offered to me wisely,” Ani said (NAN)
