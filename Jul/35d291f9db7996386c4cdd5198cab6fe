From Desmond Mgboh, Kano The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), has threatened to drag the management of Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) to court over its purported claims on the payment of N74 billion transport claims to marketers. The management of NMDPRA had on Wednesday said it had paid marketers N74 billion within the past seven months. The Chairman IPMAN Northern chapter, Bashir Danmalam made the threat while briefing  journalists in Kano Danmalam said the claim was not true, noting that IPMAN members were not paid “unless the payment was made to ghost marketers.” The IPMAN chairman challenged the management of the NMDPRA to come up with the names of all the marketers who were paid to prove their claims. “Who and who were paid the money? I know some of the marketers who are being owed N10 billion each. So for him to say that the agency paid N74 billion to marketers is not true,” he said. Danmalam said based on the investigation conducted by IPMAN, It was discovered that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had recently released over N70 billion to the agency to pay marketers, which had yet to be paid. He lamented that before now, IPMAN members were being paid their claims within one or two months as against the present system of payment.
