By Paul Erewuba Super Falcons coach Randy Waldrum has sensationally revealed that his target is to win the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations currently going on in Morocco. The Nigerian girls push for a 10th continental title with a nail-bitting 1-0 victory against Cameroon. As the championship kicked off, The Super Falcons started on the wrong foot, losing their opening match to South Africa. They have, however, picked themselves up since that defeat, securing emphatic wins against Botswana and Burundi in the group stage. The team continued with its brilliance in the quarter-finals played on Thursday, beating one of the tournament’s favourite Cameroon. Rasheedat Ajibade’s placed header, which sailed into the goalposts, ensured a semi-final ticket at the WAFCON and a World Cup berth for Nigeria. Nigeria will take on hosts Morocco for a place in the final, but Waldrum says he is looking beyond the Moroccans. Speaking immediately after the Cameroon encounter, Waldrum was reported to have said: “I am proud of my team.” “The most difficult thing for a team is to get to this point (semi-final). We had difficulties from the beginning, to overcome pitfalls. But the players defended themselves and found a way to win. “Honestly, we are very excited to qualify for the 2023 World Cup. Tonight we celebrate this success in a minimal way because we are preparing for the next target which is to win the tournament.” Pundits are of the opinion that the game against Morocco will be a tough one for the Nigerians, as they would have the home advantage. Added to this fact, the Moroccans have won all four of their games in the tournament. However, the Super Falcons would look to show their superior quality when both teams meet on Monday next week.
