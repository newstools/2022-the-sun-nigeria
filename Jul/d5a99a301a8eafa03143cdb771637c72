Barring unforeseen circumstances, the 2022 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season will come to an intriguing end on Sunday, July 17 with week 38 matches scheduled to be played across the country.  While Rivers United are set to be crowned champions at the end of their match against Gombe United at the Yakubu Gowon stadium in Port-Harcourt, the duo of Remo Stars and Kwara United will be up against Niger Tornadoes and Heartland as they make the final push for the available CAF Confederation Cup ticket. Interestingly, only one point separates third placed Remo Stars and Kwara United in the race for the continent. While Remo have 59 points from 37 matches, Kwara United have 58 points from the same number of matches. As a matter of fact, after the trio of Rangers, Enyimba and Akwa United fell out of the race for the CAF Confederation Cup ticket, it became a straight fight between Remo Stars and Kwara United. Based on their current positions on the log, Remo Stars are aware that anything less than victory would in Ikenne spell doom for them unless Niger Tornadoes fell at Heartland. On paper, the odds favour Remo Stars who are playing at home against Niger Tornadoes who have escaped relegation and can afford to lose the match.The same can’t be said of Kwara United who are away at angry Heartland who are relegation bound but may choose to play the role of a spoiler. So, with Plateau United who have already secured the second Champions League ticket even if they lose at home to Enyimba on Sunday, there is some measure of certainty concerning the top three teams that will emerge from the NPFL to represent Nigeria in the continent next season. However, for the clubs that have been engaged in relegation battles for several weeks now, there is still so much to play for on the final day, as some of them must win, even away from home, to be sure of retaining their places in the Nigerian topflight.
