From George Onyejiuwa, Owerri Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, has said he and his brother governors would ensure peace and adequate security of lives and property return in the zone before the forthcoming general election. The governor, who stated this at a South East All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders’ meeting in Owerri, Imo State, said governors of the zone would continue to provide security for the people. The Imo Governor wondered why there should be continued ait-at-home protests which had affected  commercial activities in the area. “How do you expect that people should sit at home without going to work, for no fault of theirs. And you say you are looking for Biafra? We have decided we are part and parcel of the Federal Government and the ruling party is APC. “I charge the South East leadership of our great party to constitute committees and populate these communities for APC to win elections,” he said. On the reconciliation committee of the party, the governor urged members to do more to get everybody on board, adding that efforts should be made to ensure all polling units, wards and local government areas were manned by party executives on election days and also ensure the party was voted for at all levels of the election. Uzodimma urged them not to allow distractions from detractors to bring them down but ensure their eyes were fixed on the ball and hoped that by the time the party started its campaigns which would be rooted in the grassroots, it would be remarkable as ‘bottom to top approach’ would be adopted. Also, APC National Vice President, South East, Ijeoma Arodiogbu, commended the stakeholders for the sacrifices they had made to reposition the party and ensure success at the poll. He also said the party had enjoyed tremendous support from the governor and that the party had brought a lot of goodwill to the zone through what the president, governors Uzodimma and Dave Umahi had done through their developmental strides.
