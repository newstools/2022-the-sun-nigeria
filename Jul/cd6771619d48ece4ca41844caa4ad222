Manchester City is ready to open talks with Riyad Mahrez about a new deal. The Algeria international is now inside the final year of his current contract. The Daily Mail says City are opening talks with the 31-year-old. Initial discussions have been positive and there is an expectation that Mahrez will commit his future. City are wary losing Mahrez after selling Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal and Raheem Sterling also eyeing a move away. The midfielder was a key influence on City’s Premier League title triumph last season.
