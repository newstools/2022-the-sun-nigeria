Since February 14, 2019 when he made a re-entry into the Nigerian music scene with ‘Odo’, a serenade to a reluctant love interest, fast rising singer, Ubin T. Mackson aka Binny Boy, has not relented. Riding on the waves of his hits, the Taraba State-born artiste has hinted that he is set to release a new project. Tentatively titled, ‘Ma Laide’ or ‘Pop to Your Speaker’, the singer stated that the new project draws from his emotions, pains, joy, sorrow, losses and conscious growth. “I see my music as a tool to send a message to people – a message of peace, hope, and inspiration. All of these elements have weighed in strongly in the new project. It is my own contribution to building a better society. As humans, we can never stop trying,” Binny Boy said.  Binny Boy has pooled together some form of followership both on and offline. His song, ‘Odo’ received massive airplay and recognition in the UK, pushing him to a person of interest in the music industry. Binny Boy quickly followed this up with ‘Saturday’ that cemented his place as an artiste to watch out for, gaining buzz throughout the summer of 2019 in the UK and Nigeria.  Binny Boy is currently signed to and co-owns Luminary Vision Records, a label that has grown to be a beacon for independent artistes who want to take their music to the next level. In 2021, Binny Boy released ‘Summer After Lockdown’, a compilation of his thoughts and feelings throughout the lockdown of 2020. So far, his biggest songs are ‘Nonokuno’ and ‘Flavour’ with over 100k views on the streaming platform, YouTube.
