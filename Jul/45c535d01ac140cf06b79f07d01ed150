From Obinna Odogwu, Awka The Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) of the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital (COOUTH), Amaku, Awka has said that its members would commence an indefinite strike on Thursday 28th July, 2022. This, it said, became necessary because of the failure of the management of the hospital to meet their legitimate demands or at least engage them in a roundtable discussion to iron out the issues raised. Chairman of the union, Afam Udeozo and the secretary, Lawrence Juaese, in a 21-day strike notice dated June 22, 2022 said the group had written to the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the hospital, Dr Joe Akabuike, on March 10 this year but were not attended to. “The issue then which persists is the decision of management to commence the payment of 100 per cent CONMESS salary scale whilst continuing to pay our members 70 per cent of CONHESS salary scale. “Despite all entreaties to you, both written and oral, you have remained untouched. Sir, under your leadership, members of our respective unions have suffered several injustices. We shall remain silent no more,” the letter partly reads. Other issues raised by the health workers included the alleged non-remittance of their check-off dues already deducted from their salaries to their various associations’ purse among others. In another letter dated July, 19 2022, JOHESU leadership lamented the levity with which the hospital management and the state government treated their letters. They made it clear that the indefinite strike must hold as stated. The CMD, Akabuike, when contacted, told Saturday Sun that the issues were being looked into and would be resolved as soon as possible. He said that he has the interest of his workers at heart.
