From Paul Osuyi, Asaba Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State, Kingsley Esiso, has said the mega rally scheduled to hold at Ozoro tomrrow is not to unveil the governorship candidate for next year’s election. This is coming amid reports that the event is for the unveiling of the party’s candidate when a case had been filed in the Appeal Court by Sheriff Oborevwori who won the primary on May 25. The appeal was occasioned by an Abuja High Court judgment which sacked Oborevwori over discrepancies in his certificates. The court held that David Edevbie who came second in the primary should be the candidate of the party. It was, however, learnt that the mega rally is a show of strength for the party. A source informed Daily Sun that support groups for Oborevwori have been activated for the rally. “We have been told to wear yellow T-shirt and fez caps which are branded with Oborevwori. “Also, groups were told to mount three billboards each in support of Oborevwori in all the 25 local government areas. As we speak now, all is set for the rally,” Esiso, while confirming that the rally would hold as planned, however, said the unveiling of the governorship candidate was not on the agenda of the event. He said he had not received any correspondence from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the High Court judgment sacking Oborevwori and recognising Edevbie. He also said he was not aware if there was a correspondence to that effect to the national secretariat of the party in Abuja. However, in Edevbie’s camp, his supporters see him as the authentic party’s candidate, on the grounds that INEC had issued him form E13B to fill.
