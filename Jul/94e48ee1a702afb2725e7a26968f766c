Eroton Exploration & Production Company Limited, on July 14, 2022, announced that it had successfully shut-in CAWC015 Well and contained CAWC047 wild well spill. Following the oil spill incident in Cawthorne Channel Well 15 (CAWC015L/S) which occurred on June 15 2022, the indigenous oil producer confirmed that the spill has been successfully contained and the well brought under control. The company also was please to confirm that CAWC-047 that was also vandalised within the same month and flowing to the environment since Sunday, 10th July has just been controlled today. Efforts are ongoing to complete a spill clean-up of the wellhead slot, a proper securement, and the subsequent installation of subsurface downhole plugs. Both spills were due to willful sabotage by unknown persons. In an update sent out to the press, company spokesperson, Mercy Max-Ebibai, stated that the Well engineering team and the Well Control vendor assiduously worked to establish control across all the flowing points on the vandalised wellhead. Affirming that in the light of the sabotage, the team had to fabricate a platform on a work barge (as the well head platform had been initially totally cannibalised) before control valves could be installed and well shut-in achieved. She also informed reporters that following the preliminary Joint Investigative Visit (JIV), a JIV with all relevant stakeholders, including NOSDRA, the Ministry of Environment and the community was held on the 15th of July 2022 with the intent to estimate spill volume and Post Spill Impact Assessment. Confirming that the clean-up exercise will be wrapped up at the earliest possible time. Finally, she commended members of the affected community, stating “As excellent hosts, they provided all the necessary support in arresting the situation despite the hazards posed by the incident.
