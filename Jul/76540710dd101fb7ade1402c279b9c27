By all standards, Chief Toyin Kolade is a successful businesswoman and socialite of note. For the Iyalaje Oodua, she is one of the top players in the Nigerian business circle. Her exciting journey would certainly inspire anyone who wants to succeed as an entrepreneur with interests in many sectors including maritime, oil and gas, furniture, real estate, and hospitality. No doubt, it takes a woman of guts as Kolade to thrive in the ever unpredictable business climate in Nigeria. Kolade, unarguably, commands huge respect from the young and old, especially in the political, social and business circles that have seen her as an inspiration. On Wednesday, July 13, Kolade, the Managing Director of Fisolak Global Resources, added a new age to her chequered life. Trust the ebullient socialite and woman of means; she made the day a celebration of life as she hosted select family members and friends to a lavish feast at the Marriott Hotel, Ikeja GRA, Lagos. Described as brainy, confident and intelligent, many eulogised the vivacious businesswoman for all her good deeds and abiding principle. Earlier in the day, the Iyalaje Oodua had shown her appreciation to God with a thanksgiving service even as she shared food items and cash to the less privileged to mark the occasion.
