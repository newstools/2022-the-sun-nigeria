By Lukman Olabiyi After a long period of inactivity, Alesh Hotel International located in Ajah, Lagos State, has finally reopened. According to a statement issued by the hotel’s management, the temporary closure of the hotel was sequel to a misunderstanding between the hotel and the regulatory body, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), over alleged indebtedness.  But right now, the hotel has weathered the storm going by a letter with reference number AMC/ABJ/ERM/22/841/43259, dated June 16, 2022 and jointly signed by Sulaiman Abdul Majeed and Joshua Ikioda, Head, Enterprise Risk Management and Group Head, Enforcement of AMCON. Meanwhile, the hotel has been given a face-lift to serve its numerous clientele better, and now operates a nightclub, De Commodores Nite Klub, which opens on weekends and public holidays.  Also, a lot of activities have been lined up for the Eid el Kabir festival among which is dancing competition that attracts handsome prizes for the best three dancers.
