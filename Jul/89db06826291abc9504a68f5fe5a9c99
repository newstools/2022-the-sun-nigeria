From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja   President Muhammadu Buhari said in Daura, Katsina State, on Saturday that increased disclosure of unusual activities will expose bandits and terrorists, urging the security apparatus to eliminate threats across the country. Buhari made the appeal after Eid-el-Kabir prayers in his country home, according to the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. The president urged all those who caused mayhem to innocent citizens to reflect on their actions, knowing that they had tainted their own name and the reputation of their families. “We are praying that the rainy season will be good for production of the food we eat in the country. “Look at when we closed the borders for about two years, a lot of people went back to the farms and they have not regretted that decision. Now we are feeding ourselves and exporting rice. “My advice is that people that are organising themselves and attacking institutions and communities (should refrain from doing that). The people know them. So let them report them to the security agencies. “I hope they will sit and reflect and make sure they save their names and their families,” he said. At the prayer ground, the Emir of Daura, Dr Faruk Umar Faruk, said the president had represented the Daura Emirate and indigenes well in his service to the nation, upholding his integrity at all times and working for the collective good of all. “He has done well to ensure peace and turnaround of the economy, and all that is within his capacity to promote safety in Nigeria. He remains a man of integrity, and we are proud of his achievements. “For more than seven years, he has been working for the good of the country. We pray that God will surround him with people that will help him,” he said. The emir said the community was proud of the president, knowing his penchant for fairness, justice and upholding the rule of law.
