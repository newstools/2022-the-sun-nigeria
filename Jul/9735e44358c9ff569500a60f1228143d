From Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja Nigerian beauty queen turned philanthropist, Tracy Solomon has launched another health campaign to sensitise students in the Federal Capital Territory on menstrual hygiene health and management. The event which was organised through her office, Face of Nigeria, in partnership with her foundation, Tracy Solomon foundation, was held at the Junior Secondary School Area 1 Garki, Abuja. Menstrual Hygiene Day, annually celebrated on May 28 in many countries around the globe, is to highlight the importance of menstrual care, and raise awareness about issues faced by women and girls who don’t have access to clean water and sanitary products. According to statistics, 44% of Nigerian girls are facing extreme poverty and cannot afford the average cost of a pack of pads. Up to 1 in 10 Nigerian girls miss school during their Period because of the inability to access these basic needs. Tracy noted that she has moved to end the stigma and intensify her personal effort to build a world where no woman and girl is held back because she menstruates. She said: “Being FACE OF NIGERIA I can’t just sit and do nothing to help Nigerian Girl Child. So, i decided to fight period poverty by providing menstrual health support to the Girl Child in Junior Secondary School Area 1 Garki Abuja”. “My advocacy is also to campaign and END PERIOD POVERTY IN NIGERIA. This is a process that needs to be supported and collectively we can build a better Nation where girls have access to menstrual hygiene education and free pads”. The beauty queen has so far donated thousands of period pads to the public schools in FCT Abuja and was able to pay school fees for 40 students. She also awarded scholarship to one of the student by paying her school fee up until she graduates from secondary school. Attachments area
