By Monica Ihaeakam Nigeria’s fast rising sprint sensation Favour Ofili says she is heading to the World Championship not to make up for the numbers but to win in Oregon. Ofili is among the 22 man list released by the Athletics Federation of Nigeria for the championship in Oregon , USA on July 15. Speaking to Olympics.com, the 19 year-old NCAA champion said she is heading to Oregon for the win regardless of who is competing on the tracks against her. “My mandate is to go there and win regardless of what happens. Run each heat, semi-finals fast and advance. Once you get to the finals anything can happen. I am going there to win.” “We (African sprinters) now believe in ourselves. We now believe that anything is possible. We believe that if they can do that, I can also do better. (Others saying,) ‘Oh, she’s from Nigeria? Africa? I can do better than her! Oh, Kenya? He ran that time?’ That is the motivation that triggers us.” But her eyes will be on five-time Olympic champion Thompson-Herah, one of a number of Ofili’s idols.”
