From Magnus Eze, Enugu The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worlwide has told the Igbo not to despair over the historic injustice they suffered in Nigeria especially with the outcome of the primary elections of the two major political parties. President General of Ohanaeze, Prof George Obiozor, on Sunday, rather urged them to wait for the verdict of history as according to him, what those who thought they were victorious at the moment had was momentary. Reacting to the presidential nominations by the All Peoples Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which favoured Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar respectively, he said it was now clear that the Nigerian national political elite had successfully orchestrated to deny the South-East an opportunity to produce the country’s next president. Describing the gross historic injustice demonstrated towards Ndigbo by this machination as beyond expectations, he wondered what actually Nigeria wanted from Ndigbo. According to a statement by National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, Dr Alex Ogbonnia, the Igbo leader who is convalescing in a Dubai hospital noted that Nigeria, by the deliberate injustice had failed the Rotary Club International four way tests, namely: Is it the Truth? Is it fair to all concerned? Will it build goodwill and better friendships? And will it be beneficial to all concerned? “For Ndigbo, I urge us not to lament much but wait for the verdict of history. “In the end, this political manipulation will end in a pyrrhic victory for those who rejoice and celebrate injustice. “I want to also use this opportunity to appreciate all those Nigerian statesmen and patriots across the country, who supported the idea for the South East to produce the president of Nigeria in 2023, based on Nigerian proven history of rotation of power between the north and the south as well as commitment to equity, justice and fairness,” Obiozor stated.
