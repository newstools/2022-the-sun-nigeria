Ogun State Property and Investment Corporation (OPIC) in partnership with a new road solution, Road Rapid, has commissioned OPIC road 1 & 3, area 4 of Agbara Estate. This is the first major road to be treated with Road Rapid products for durable, all-year earth roads capable of  lasting six rainy seasons. Addressing journalists, the Managing Director, OPIC, Mr. Babajide Odusolu, said the measure was taken to save costs and attract more investors to the state. He said: “OPIC Agbara is the oldest industrial area in Nigeria. It is 34 years old. Within those 34 years until the last six years, what we do was to open up a road, do grading on some of them, but because of funds we don’t go further than that. “However, when this new administration took over, under the mission to rebuild agenda, we recognised that we have to deepen the internal revenue of the state by attracting more businesses. With the mission and vision to get people to come to the state, they would need, security, power, and good roads. We all know road is very expensive, especially in a waterlogged area. It is quite expensive to work on”. The OPIC boss said “we have been looking out for different solutions and strategies to make it work. Then came the introduction of Road Rapid, which would help us even more. As of the last six years, we have done over 10 kilometers of new roads. “However, in few years to come we hope to do more than 20 kilometers, because Road Rapid has come into the picture. What the solution does, is to reduce the cost of doing our roadwork. Efforts is ongoing to take care of all the roads’’.
