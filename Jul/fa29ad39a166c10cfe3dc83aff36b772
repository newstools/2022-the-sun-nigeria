From Noah Ebije, Kaduna Kaduna Government has beefed up security throughout the state against circulated reports of plans by terrorists to launch attacks on the state. To this end, security agencies have enhanced collaborative measures in view of the circulated reports of security threats by terrorists. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement, said security agencies would continue to monitor the situation with optimal alertness and urgency. “The attention of the Kaduna State government has been drawn to a circulated intelligence extract highlighting a plan by armed bandits to attack Kaduna and environs. The state government appeals first, for the continued vigilance of all citizens as the state continues to confront security challenges. “The government wishes to inform citizens that it is constantly engaging with the security agencies, assisting with collaborative efforts, and supporting them with logistics and effective coordination of intelligence gathering and response. “It assures residents that security agencies will continue to monitor the situation with optimal alertness and appropriate urgency. “Residents are thus encouraged to maintain vigilance but go about their normal activities as security agencies work assiduously to eliminate threats. “The security operations room is open 24 hours a day to receive information on suspicious activity or threats across the state. “In line with these enhanced efforts, security forces within the last 48 hours intercepted some bandits and gunrunners at Kidunu general area around Eastern By-Pass, Chikun council. “After an exchange of fire, one bandit was neutralised, later confirmed to be a notorious bandit terrorising the area. Two AK-47 rifles, along with charms and amulets, a mobile phone and two motorcycles, were recovered,” he said.
