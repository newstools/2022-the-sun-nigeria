From Obinna Odogwu, Awka anambra Central senatorial district’s candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the 2023 elections, Kodilichukwu Okelekwe, has dismissed claims that his party has a number of factions in the state. He said although there were a few challenges bedevilling the party as also seen in other parties, the APC was taking necessary steps to strengthen the unity of its members in the state. Okelekwe stated this at the Anambra Central senatorial stakeholders’ meeting convened by him at Nibo Civic Centre, Nibo in Awka South Local Government Area. He said the party has about 450,000 members in the state and that it would utilise that numerical strength to win the next year’s polls at all levels, especially in the state. “My mantra is people centred representation and optimum results. I used the word optimum which means for those that are there now, they have done their level best. But where better is possible, you don’t look at good. “And where best is possible you don’t look at better. That’s why I am talking of optimum results. That’s what I promised my people and they know that I have the capacity to do so because I have proven that in my personal life.”
