Renowned transfer market guru, Paolo Bargiggia believes Serie A giant, Napoli would be able to bring in a quality replacement should Victor Osimhen leave the Diego Maradona Stadium this summer. But Bargiggia insists that despite all the reported interests in Osimhen, no club has submitted any bid for the Super Eagles forward. When asked if Napoli have a plan B in the event of allowing Osimhen to join another club, Bargiggia told 1 Station Radio (as per Tutto Napoli): “To date, there are no offers for the Nigerian.  “De Laurentiis’ request would be around 130 million euros. There are plans because Napoli could never be caught unprepared on the transfer market, but currently no offers have been submitted.” Manchester United, Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, and Arsenal were all credited with an interest in Victor Osimhen long before the transfer window officially opened. But none of the Premier League moneybags have firmed up their interest in the former Lille lad. Bayern Munich could still make a move for the 23-year-old forward after watching star man Robert Lewandowski leave for Barcelona. Osimhen, however, remains calm and committed to his contract at Napoli, with the Lagos-born striker currently in the club’s preseason camp in Dimaro. The 2022-23 Serie A season kicks off on Saturday, August 13. Napoli will play their first league match away to Verona on Monday, August 15.
