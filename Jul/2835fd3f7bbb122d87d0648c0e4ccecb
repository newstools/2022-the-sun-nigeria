It was all applause and encomium when singer and producer, Evangelist Omotayo Paul Oniya led his band to release the group’s sensational album titled “Yoruba is my heritage”. The new album, produced by versatile Samuel Gbenga Oniyide (Uncle Sam) of Samtone Music, was released recently at a well-attended album launch.  Speaking on what inspired the album and its title, Oniya revealed that his vision is to reach out to people of different cultures. To him, music knows no boundary and he then gives kudos to his British-born partner and wife, Ceecee Ibukunoluwa Oniya popularly known as Oyinbo Yoruba, who rendered powerful vocal in pure Yoruba language to encourage many people across the globe that there is hope after the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Paul and Ceecee Oniya Gospel Music Group, during the pandemic, reached out to the world with their message of hope to encourage many people, deploying their mastery of the dynamics of African cultural tones. The new album, according to music buffs, has reconfirmed the dexterity and professionalism of Oniya who composed all the songs in the album.
