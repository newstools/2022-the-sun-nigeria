Edo Deputy Governor, Mr Philip Shaibu, said the state was ready to support the committee inaugurated to organise the second edition of the Betsy Obaseki Women Pre-Season Football Championship in the state. Speaking in Benin on Friday night at the inauguration of the Organising Committee of the tournament Shaibu said the annual tournament had improved women football in Nigeria. “As a government, we are thankful to you (First Lady) for this initiative. We want to return Edo State to the number one sporting destination in Nigeria. We want to make our state a hub for all sporting activities. “Most importantly, this tournament is one that has also come at a time when we are fighting the ills in society, especially illegal migrations, drug abuse and other vices.” Shaibu said hosting the first edition of the tournament in 2021 exposed the challenges confronting the girl-child through strategic engagement with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and Federation of International Football Association (FIFA). “I was at the 72nd FIFA Convention in Qatar recently. A major focus for FIFA in the next five years is the promotion of female soccer and I was impressed when competitions such as ours were mentioned as an example of what needs to be promoted in Africa. “I was invited because of some of the things we are doing in dealing with issues of female involvement in sports.” In her remarks, the Edo First said, “The inauguration of the organising committee is the first event that signals the commencement of preparations for the tournament. “The proposed date for this year’s tournament will hold from Sept. 7 to Sept. 17, 2022. We are going to have the tournament for about 10 to 11 days. (NAN)
