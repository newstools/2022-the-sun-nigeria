In his prime, the billionaire scion of the Ibru dynasty, Olorogun Oskar CJ Ibru, is reputed for throwing some of the best parties in this part of the world. Even as he becomes a senior citizen and granddad, the man fondly called OCJ remains a chronic ultimate rocker —although age has a way of slowing some folks down including this amiable billionaire. His last well advertised blowout bash was the celebration of his diamond age in August 2018 in Aburi, Ghana. And then there was a break. In between was his battle with the COVID-19 virus that almost claimed his life, his recovery and discharge from the intensive care unit of one of the Lagos highbrow hospitals. After the hiatus, he returned fully to the social circuit in April this year when his last daughter, Nenesi Ibru had the traditional wedding ceremony with her lover, Chinedu Okeke at his palatial mansion in Agbarha-Otor, Delta State. Prior to then, the couple —Nenesi, who runs The French Tips Cafe, a tea and pastry shop, and Chinedu, a creative industrialist— had exchanged their vows at the Ikoyi Registry in the presence of their family and friends in November, 2021. But on 25 June, Ibru dragged select powerful guests to Marrakech, Morocco where he formally gave out Nenesi’s hand in marriage at a stylish destination white wedding. At the Moroccan nuptials, it was love, laughter, fascinators, pastels, vintage cars and classic foods. During the colourful church ceremony, the proud father of the bride was resplendent in his rich traditional Delta ensemble as he walked his daughter down the aisle. It was followed by a lavish reception and later a dope wedding party which took place inside The Amanjena Resort in Marrakech, Morocco with celebrity DJ Obi behind the wheel of steel.
