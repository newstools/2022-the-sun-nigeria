From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Daughters of Ngwa land, under the aegis  of Ngwa Daughters Development Association (NDDA), Abuja branch, have endorsed the governorship aspiration of the Chancellor of Gregory University, Uturu, (GUU), Prof Gregory Ibe. Speaking when the group paid Ibe a courtesy visit, the group’s president, Ngozi Nwaokenneya urged Ibe not to quiver in his pursuit to govern Abia State as they were solidly behind him. She said apart from endorsing the GUU Chancellor, the women also came to convey “the unanimous decision of the entire members of Ngwa Daughters Development Association worldwide to confer on him an Award of Excellence in recognition of of his immense contributions towards Women, Children and Youth Empowerment.” Nwaokenneya said the award would  be presented to Prof Ibe in a special event to “celebrate women, promote Ngwa/Igbo culture and recognise men and women who have distinguished themselves by empowering the widows, youth, children, women, orphans and less privileged people in our society to create a positive impact on their lives and to give them hope to live for tomorrow.” Ibe, who is  governorship candidate for the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), pledged to implement an all inclusive governance policy that would be gender sensitive if elected.
