The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) has appealed to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to call off the over five months strike to allow students go back to continue their studies. NUJ also called on the Federal Government to address issues of security, healthcare, food security, inflation, rule of law and intimidation of journalists in the country. NUJ National President, Chris Isiguzo made the call in his state of the nation press conference on Thursday in Abuja. “We have looked at the abysmal situation in the education sector with particular reference to tertiary education in the country vis-à-vis the five months old strike embarked upon by ASUU. “We appeal to the leadership and members of ASUU to in the overall interest of the nation, accept some of the offers the Federal Government is proposing to allow for the resumption of academic activities in the universities. “We can only remain and call ourselves Nigerians only on the premise of the fact that there is a country known and addressed as Nigeria.’’ He said a look at developments within the country, it “does not require beating the drums for any discerning and critical mind to know, understand and appreciate the need for an urgent appraisal to assist the country.’’
