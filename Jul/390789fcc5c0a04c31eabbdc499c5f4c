Super Eagles strikers Paul Onuachu and Cyriel Dessers can look elsewhere for work after Italian Serie A side Fiorentina decided against signing any of the two Nigerian attackers. Fiorentina sanctioned the departure of star forward Dusan Vlahovic for 80 million euros in January and were keen on a quality replacement this summer. I Viola had quite a number of strikers on their radar, including Genk’s Nigerian forward Paul Onuachu. The former FC Midtjylland striker was the leading goalscorer in the Belgian Jupiler Pro League last year. The 27-year-old was equally the recipient of the Belgian Golden Shoe, an award given to the overall best player in Belgium. It would take at least €15 million to convince Genk to part with the gangling goal king. Another Genk-owned Super Eagles star Cyriel Dessers was also linked with a move to the Stadio Artemio Franchi, as Fiorentina continued their search for attacking reinforcement. Dessers excelled in the Europa Conference League last season, finishing as the competition’s top goalscorer with ten goals while on loan at Feyenoord. At €4.5 million, he represents a cheaper alternative than his compatriot Onuachu. But Fiorentina have decided against signing either of the two Nigerian target men, opting instead for out-of-favour Real Madrid forward Luka Jović. Having spent last season on loan at Frankfurt, the 24-year-old Serbian striker joins Fiorentina on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract. While Onuachu appears to have played his last game for Genk, the club remains open to keeping Dessers on their payroll, at least for another season.
