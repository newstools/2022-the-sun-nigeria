From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) has tasked the Federal Government to immediately conclude ongoing negotiations with trade unions in public universities, including the  Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU and be prepared to commence implementation of whatever Collective Bargaining Agreements  arising from its negotiations.  This is as the union  disclosed plans to embark on a nationwide protest on July 26 and 27 in solidarity with the striking lecturers. NLC in a letter co-signed by its National President, Ayuba Wabba, and General Secretary, Emmanuel Ugboaja, said the protest was targetted at getting Nigerian children in public universities back to school and supporting ASUU in its fight for quality education, improved infrastructure and remuneration for workers. The later dated July 15 was addressed to chairpersons of the NLC in the states with the NLC Secretariat in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) designated as takeoff points for the protest. NLC in a separate statement, also faulted the Federal Government’s purported rejection of the Nimi-Briggs Committee report of the university based union’s negotiations.  According to NLC, the alleged  action is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the ILO Convention Number 98 ratified by Nigeria and which core principle is ‘Negotiation in Good Faith.’ Tasking the Federal Government to urgently conclude negotiations with trade unions in Nigeria’s universities and commence implementation of  arising from it, the NLC  said the government should “immediately pay the salaries of striking university workers which had been frozen on the premise of the so-called ‘no work-no pay’ policy, especially as recommended by the leaders of Nigeria’s two major faiths.” “Since the Federal Government decided to set up the Nimi-briggs Committee to make recommendations on the review of the salaries of workers in Nigeria’s university, the negotiating unions and the Nigeria Labour Congress have been kept in the dark on the report of the Committee. It is, therefore, a shocker for us to read from the media snippets of a report of what is strictly the product of a negotiation between the Federal Government Committee and the concerned trade unions,” it said.
