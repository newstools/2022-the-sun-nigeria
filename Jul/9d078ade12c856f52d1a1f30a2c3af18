The newly elected president of the Nigeria Rugby Football Federation, Kelechi Mbagwu has described his election as the president of Nigeria Rugby as a New dawn for the survival of the sport in the country. Mbagwu who defeated his opponent, Hamza Attah with 28 votes to 10 to emerge victorious said the victory is not for him but the entire Nigeria Rugby family. The philanthropist, who has personally been sponsoring Nigeria Rugby for the past 20 years in both National and International Championships non-stop, said he is out to run an all-inclusive administration for the benefit of the sport more so when he is operating in a familiar zone. “And now that the elections are over, all stakeholders must come together in the interest of the game so that together we can take Nigeria Rugby to the next level. “Rugby is one united and indivisible family that no one can separate. We know ourselves by state, names and clubs and as such nothing can come in-between us. Just like I did say earlier, my main agenda and mission is to put proper structure in place for Nigeria Rugby within the next few years and this I cannot do alone hence the need for everyone to come together for this,” Mbagwu stressed.
