It’s a new week and you are probably wondering what to venture into to stay afloat, increase your income or possibly even break the bank. In Nigeria, sports betting has become a thing – it is not uncommon to see people making bets at centers, homes, cars, during dinners or anywhere and anytime. But did you know this could also be a source of income? There are a lot of betting companies in Nigeria, but only one allows you to rule your kingdom which is BetKing, a leading sports betting and digital entertainment company with a presence across Nigeria. Chukwuemeka Donatus Orji, a BetKing agent in Lagos, also known as a Kingmaker, shared his experience with the sports betting company since he joined them 4 years ago. In the video, you see Chukwuemeka narrating how his life experienced a turnaround since he became a Kingmaker. “I started with a shop at Iponri. Currently, I’m running three different shops with the fourth one on its way. I’m now a proud owner of a house, all thanks to BetKing,” Chukwuemeka shares on his business expansion. In addition to providing an opportunity to be your own boss, BetKing empowers its agents with a variety of perk-filled initiatives. Recently, the company rolled out 100 fully furnished shops to long-standing agents across Nigeria to appreciate them for their loyalty and being a part of the BetKing agent network and partnered with DSTV to reward new agents with free equipment and one-month subscription, to mention a few. Like new football season only weeks away, there’s no better time than now to build your dream. Chukwuemeka said, “I’m a proud Kingmaker.”
