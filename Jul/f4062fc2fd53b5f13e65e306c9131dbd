JUmia has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Realme, the world’s fastest-growing smartphone brand, to provide millions of consumers in Africa access to innovative and trend-setting devices with the latest technology. The agreement allows for Realme to have an official store on Jumia’s platform that would connect it with online consumers across 11 African countries, initially including Nigeria and gradually expanding to Kenya, Ghana, and Ivory Coast, and, thereafter, to the remaining African countries where Jumia operates. Vice President, Consumer Electronics for Jumia, Sandeep Narayanan, said the firm was  delighted in the partnership with Realme as it provided an  opportunity to grow and access the African market. “Both of our companies share similar values and we look forward to a collaboration that would provide Jumia’s consumers access to best-in-class, affordable smartphones via Jumia’s seamless shopping experience. Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the world’s fastest-growing mobile regions and millions of African mobile users use a smartphone to access Jumia for their everyday needs. “With this in mind, we look forward to further enhancing the penetration of e-commerce in the region,” Narayanan said.
