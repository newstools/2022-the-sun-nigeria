Securing a hotel accommodation in Osogbo, the Osun State capital has become a major headache as so many visitors and dignitaries have continued to troop to the state since this week ahead of Saturday’s poll. Checks by our correspondent revealed that some expensive hotels in the town have been fully booked by politicians, security agents, journalists and international observers. The chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, disclosed that 87 observer groups (79 domestic and 8 international) deploying a total of 7,790 field agents have been accredited for the election. He said that 94 media organisations (92 national and 2 international) with 624 journalists have been accredited to cover the election.” Meanwhile, some journalists were not captured by the data provided by INEC as the commission also did manual accreditation for those that are missing in the captured figure.
