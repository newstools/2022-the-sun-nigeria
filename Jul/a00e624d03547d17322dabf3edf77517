By Paul Erewuba Ahead of the opening Group C game against Banyana Banyana of South Africa, Super Falcons and Gotham FC forward Ifeoma Onumonu has stated that Super Falcons remain the best team in the continent at the moment.. Onumonu who was born in California, United State will be making her debut in the competition and she has reportedly set her eyes on winning the trophy for Nigeria. While speaking to ESPN, monitored in youtube video, the US-based striker said she was new to the team but remained optimistic about getting a positive result for Nigeria. “[We] lost it a few years ago, but the goal this year is we’re not allowing that to happen again. Especially with the quality of this team. It’s not a lie, I think that there is no African team that is better than Nigeria at this moment. “So, I just can’t wait to start the competition and bring it home.” “I think the most difficult part for me is sort of being new… but not new. Like, in the US I’m a veteran player, but with the Nigerian national team, I’m a new player. So it’s sort of trying to like find out where I fit in. “I’m 28 years old so I’m very comfortable with who I am in a sense, but then getting put in the position of being a rookie again, trying to figure it out, trying to integrate and not allowing myself to be uncomfortable. “I understand that I am new to the situation and so I am the one who’s going to have to change to some degree and not ask other players to change to suit me and being okay with that. “So I think for me, that was sort of the hardest part to wrap my head around because, again, I’m a veteran rookie, in some sense which is very difficult to balance,” she was quoted to have to told ESPN.
