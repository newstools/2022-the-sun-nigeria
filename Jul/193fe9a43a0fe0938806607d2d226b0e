From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, charged the National Assembly to thoroughly investigate the alleged collapse of the security architecture in the country . The PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, condemn the worsening insecurity and audacity of alleged terrorists rampaging across the country. The opposition party said the simultaneous terrorist attacks on the advance convoy of President Muhammadu Buhari in Katsina State as well as the Kuje Custodial Centre, indicates the alleged “collapse of our security command and control structure under” under the All Progressives Congress ( APC) led Federal Government. The opposition party challenged the Federal Government to come clean on who  allegedly ordered the reported redeployment of soldiers and who failed to act on the intelligence provided by the DSS, prior to the attack on the Kuje Custodial Centre. “Nigerians can recall the public confession by the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai at the wake of the bloody Abuja-Kaduna terrorist attack that the APC-led administration knows the whereabouts and the plans of the terrorists ravaging our nation but deliberately refused to act. Nigerians will also recall how APC leaders publicly romanced and paid money to terrorists. “It is rather distressing that President Buhari appears helpless without any decisive and concrete steps taken to stem the tide of terrorist attacks in our country… “With the sequence of events in the last 48 hours, it is clear to Nigerians that the APC government headed by President Buhari has failed in the basic purpose of government which is to secure life and properties of the citizens. “Given the urgency of the security situation in the country, it has become imperative that President Buhari convenes an emergency Council of State meeting for a review of the prevailing dangerous security atmosphere in our country,” it stated.
