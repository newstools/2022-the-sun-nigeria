According to Tee-A, the show producer, the annual music concert will be a high-octane event with a lot of high-value corporate and private clientele expected. While the main goal would be to bring music lovers together at Eko Hotels and Suites to enjoy exhilarating soulful tunes and total music experiences with their favourite Nigerian R’n’B music superstars.
