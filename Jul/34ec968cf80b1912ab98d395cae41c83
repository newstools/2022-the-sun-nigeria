Amstel Malta Ultra, the official Malt drink of the Super Falcons is confident the Nigeria national women’s team will get off to a positive start on Monday when they take on South Africa’s Bayana Bayana in their opening game of the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco. Even though many believe the wide gap between the Super Falcons and Bayana Bayana has greatly reduced, Amstel Malta Ultra believes Coach Randy Waldrum and his Ladies have what it takes to shoot down their fierce South African rivals For over four years, Amstel Malta Ultra has been one of the key brands supporting the Super Falcons and nourishing them to greater heights. Now, the world-class brewed Malt Drink says it is firmly rooting for the Falcons to show the continent once more why they are the number one and record champions of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. Brand Manager Amstel Malta, Maire Abia-Bassey, said the Super Falcons are fully aware they need to hit the ground running in their first match against South Africa and she doesn’t expect anything short of victory from the Ladies. She said: “Amstel Malta Ultra is always proud of our ladies, we know what they have done in the past and what they are capable of doing now. The goal is to take each game as it comes, beginning with the group opener against South Africa which we believe the Super Falcons will carry the day.  While the Super Falcons have gotten to nine WAFCON finals and won all, Bayana Bayana have made it into four finals but lost all and are desperate for a change in fortunes in Morocco. With the likes of Asisat Oshoala ready to lead the attack up front and captain Onome Ebi coordinating affairs from the rear, the Nigerian women should be able to get the three points in Monday’s tie.  After Monday’s epic clash against South Africa’s Banyana Banyana, the Super Falcons have other games against Botswana (7th July) and Burundi (10th July).
