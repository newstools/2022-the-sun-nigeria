From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan   A former governor of Oyo State, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, has said there is nothing wrong with a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket in 2023, but for concerns over the safety of Christians. He made the disclosure in an interview with journalists at his Bodija residence in Ibadan after he observed this year’s Eid-el-Kabir prayers at the University of Ibadan Central Mosque yesterday. Ladoja also appealed to Nigerians to keep praying for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, not to be treated like the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, Basorun MKO Abiola, who died in 1998. His words: “There are many factors involved in electing a president. Whoever wants to be president and those working for him have to work very hard. In fact, they will need more prayers as they are consulting. With all these efforts, God has the final say on who becomes president. Chief MKO Abiola, who was a Muslim, was elected along with his deputy, a Muslim.  “We only pray that if Tinubu wins, it is not turned to be like that of late Chief MKO Abiola. I don’t see anything wrong with a Muslim-Muslim ticket because I don’t intervene in religious matters.  “Muslims and Christians are from the same father. Some people are following Ismail, while some are following Isaac who are siblings. So, what is now my own to be fighting for one among them? Even, I don’t have time to fight with traditionalists.”
