By Bolaji Okunola Super Eagles defensive midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi has been labelled ‘king’ by Foxes fans after regaining fitness  from a knee injury he suffered early this year. Ndidi had picked up an injury against Rennes in the Europa Conference League, with his absence felt in the Super Eagles and Foxes. Going by the club latest tweet, the former Genk midfielder is back in contention and has resumed training two days ago with the rest of the Leicester squad. The £60m-valued player has been linked with an exit from the King Power Stadium this year but that is far from definite as the player hasn’t shown any open desire to leave. Ndidi will be key to Leicester next season if they have plans for a resurgence as they sorely missed the midfielder last season after suffering from various fitness problems. With his return announced, Leicester fans and supporters of the player expressed their happiness about his return. Some of the welcoming quotes were “the king is back” and “the goat is back” amongst others. Ndidi has the reputation of being one of European football’s finest ball winners and defensive midfielders.
