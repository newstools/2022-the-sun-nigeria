As the choice of the All Progressives Congress (APC) running mate continues to generate ripples, former presidential aspirant and chieftain of the ruling APC,  Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has urged opinion moulders not to allow religion to further divide the country. In a statement from his media office in Abuja, yesterday, Olawepo-Hashim explained that the political aspiration of anybody is not worth the disruption of the unity and peace of Nigeria. “While we all have the right to express ourselves,  we should avoid incendiary comments that can further pose huge challenge to our national integration objectives. Let us quietly make our decisions  and express such decisions with our votes.” Olawepo-Hashim said political parties who are insensitive to national concerns and took  some segments of the population for granted must be ready to be punished by the electorates at the polls. “That is democracy there is no need for quarrel,” he said. He said every party must work hard towards the general election to ensure that they are in good reckoning with the electorate at the polls, adding that “those who have bought delegates must know they will have an uphill task buying an estimated 40 million potential voters who may turn out at the next election… “Anyone who loves his or her party, and loves Nigeria must ensure that their parties do the right things. Buying up delegates at the party conventions is the cheapest thing to do, the general election is a different ball game. National Security is at stake, not just anything will pass,” he said. He also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to live up to his promise of ensuring a a free and fair election in 2023.
