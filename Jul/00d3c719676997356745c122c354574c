From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Abdullahi Adamu, on his 76th birthday, July 23, 2022. In a statement by Special Adviser to the President Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari said he joined the National Executive Committee, National Working Committee, and all members to celebrate with the political leader. He praised the former Nasarawa State governor for his vision and courage in advancing democracy and governance in the country. He noted that Adamu began his political career in 1977 as a member of the Constituent Assembly, which drafted the 1979 constitution, and was a member of the Constitutional Conference in 1994. The President lauded the APC National Chairman for the political party’s ongoing repositioning on a conciliatory path, with a greater emphasis on strengthening internal democratic processes, providing good governance, and realising the mandate of ensuring a better life for Nigerians through a collective vision. President Buhari believes Adamu’s versatility in politics remains an asset to the party and country, having served as a founding member of the National Party of Nigeria, Minister of State for Works and Housing, and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum. The President prayed for God’s blessings and abundance of health and strength for the Sarkin Yakin Keffi and Aare Obateru of Ife.
