From Okey Sampson, Umuahia   The Federal Commissioner representing Abia State at the National Population Commission (NPC), Chief Nwabuisi Nwanne has said that Biafra agitators do not have any reason to disrupt next year’s census exercise in the state. Nwanne who spoke in Umuahia while responding to a question during press briefing on the conduct of “Trial Census” for the 2023 Population and Housing Census, said what happened in the state during the 2006 census exercise where some people were discouraged from being counted on account of being Biafrans and not Nigerians, should not be allowed to repeat. “We had a situation in 2006 where a group agitating for Biafra sold a dummy to people in the state not to present themselves to be counted during that year’s census exercise as they were not Nigerians, and that impacted negatively on the state population after the exercise as it made Abia to be under-counted.” Nwanne said the beauty of next year’s exercise is that even if any group was clamouring for a referendum for Biafra, the population the world body would rely on would be that conducted by Nigeria. “Even if any group agitating for Biafra is clamouring for a referendum, the population the United Nations will be relying on for such exercise, will be the one conducted by Nigeria, and that is why everybody should come out and be counted instead of the other way round.
