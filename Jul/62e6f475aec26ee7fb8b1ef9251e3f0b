Here is a man who, over the years has empowered both men and women, young and old in different forms.“Even though the state Treasury has been mismanaged and burden of debts kept increasing, the financial responsiveness of Barde as evident in the companies he had built all the years , he will no doubt resuscitate the comatose state of the Gombe economy and sustain it, making it viable to compete with other states like Lagos in terms of human capital development and infrastructures.“We urge all the good people of Gombe to make a good choice in the forthcoming election by voting for the PDP at all levels for a better life for the people.“We call on all our people to go out in their numbers to register for their voters cards and also pick them up so they can exercise their franchise in sending the APC government packing for the damages they have done against them.”
