By Lukman Olabiyi Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has urged Yoruba sons and daughters to rally around Bola Ahmed Tinubu to actualise his dream of becoming the next president in 2023. He said there was more to benefit by Nigerians, Nigeria and especially Yoruba if Tinubu becomes president in 2023. The governor made the plea while speaking as special guest of honour at the grand finale of the 2022 edition of Ojude -Oba festival in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State, yesterday. “Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, let me use this opportunity to make this rallying call on all true sons and daughters of the Yoruba race and pronounce that in the unifying spirit of the Ojude Oba celebration, it is my firm hope and belief that the Yoruba race will unite as one behind the momentous candidature of Tinubu, a proud son of the race and one of the most formidable and experienced politicians to have ever emerged from Africa.” Sanwo-Olu was the third governor of Lagos State to participate in the annual festival which was last held in 2019 due to COVD-19 pandemic, after Michael Otedola and Tinubu. The festival hosted by the Awujale of Ijebu and Paramount Ruler of Ijebu Land, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, was graced by many dignitaries, including the state governor and  his deputy, Dapo Abiodun, Noimot Salako-Oyedele, past governors of the state, Olusegun Osoba, and Gbenga Daniel among others.
