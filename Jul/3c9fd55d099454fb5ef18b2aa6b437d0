From Lateef Dada, Osogbo An Islamic group, Tijjaniyya Grassroots Mobilisation and Movement Initiative of Nigeria (TIGMEIN) has promised to mobilise its members across Osun State for the reelection of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on July 16. TIGMEIN members disclosed that their members across the state had embarked on grassroots mobilisation and door-to-door campaigns to ensure the re-election of Oyetola. The Islamic group said their support for Oyetola was informed by his outstanding performance, verifiable credentials and track records in the last three and a half years, saying he had not disappointed the state and the Muslim community. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to governor Oyetola, Ismail Omipidan, stated that the National Coordinator of TIGMEIN, Sheikh Ahmad-Tijani Thanni Awwal, spoke during a programme held in Osogbo, Sunday. The group lauded the achievements of Oyetola since the assumption of office, noting that he has proven to the world that Muslims are responsible and responsive to being entrusted with power. “We are committed to this project and I can assure you of block votes coming from us. We have no choice but to do this. Aside from the fact that you are the only Muslim governor in all the 17 southern states, this noble decision is the only way to reciprocate your kind gestures and monumental strides across strata of the economy in the state,” the statement added. Governor Oyetola thanked members of TIGMEIN all over the world particularly in Osun for their unflinching support and cooperation, saying their endorsement was an appreciation of the little things God had made him do.
