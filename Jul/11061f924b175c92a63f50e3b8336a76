From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has removed the Chairman of Obingwa Local Government Area, Mr. One Nwoke and replaced him with Mrs Uloma Nwogu, his deputy, who has subsequently been sworn in. He, has however,  faulted the process of his removal and vowed to challenge the governor’s action in court. In a telephone chat with Daily Sun after his removal, he queried the right of the governor to remove an elected LGA chairman for defecting to another party. Last week, it was alleged that councillors in the LGA  were making moves to impeach the sacked chairman, but that never happened. Speaking at Nwogu’s swearing in ceremony held at the Executive Council Chambers, Government House Umuahia, yesterday, Ikpeazu said he was in receipt of a letter dated May 23, 2022, written by the former Executive Chairman of Obingwa LGA Hon Nwoke entitled: “Resignation of my party membership.” The governor stated that in consonance with the laws guiding the Abia State Local Government System, Nwoke breached the provisions of Section 23, Sub -section 1(f) of the Abia State Local Government Law No. 2 of 2006. The governor said that the law makes it imperative for a new chairman to be sworn in to take over the reigns of power at Obingwa Local Government. He said the event marks a milestone in the development of the local government system, noting that his administration was the only one that conducted LGA elections for two consecutive times within his tenure. He congratulated the new chairman and enjoined her to protect the interest of Obingwa and Abia State. Nwogu thanked the governor for finding her worthy to serve and promised not to disappoint him and the state. The oaths of office and allegiance were administered on the new Chairman by the Solicitor General and Permanent Secretary of the ministry of Justice, Mrs Uzoamaka Ikonne.
