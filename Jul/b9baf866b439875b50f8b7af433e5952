It has now emerged that Romelu Lukaku arrived for Inter Milan’s pre-season training overweight. It is understood that the burly striker was out of shape after he completed his move from Chelsea. Lukaku spent one season away in London, where things did not turn out as expected. After conducting an authorised interview, he fell out with Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel and the club’s fanbase. He had initially signed a five-year deal to join Chelsea, but both parties agreed to cut their ties and sent him back on loan at Inter Milan. He had thrived in Italy the season before, where he helped Inter Milan win their first Scudetto since 2010. But as Daily Mail reports, Inter Milan physios were worried after Lukaku came back slightly overweight.
