From Aloysius Attah, Onitsha The Onitsha Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (ONICCIMA) has  identified infrastructural decay, touting and illegal checkpoints as multiple factors affecting business in the commercial city of Onitsha, Anambra State. ONICCIMA President, Chief Kevin Obieri, in a press briefing in Onitsha yesterday said the chamber appreciates the efforts of the state government led by Governor Chukwuma Soludo, in providing workable solutions and tackling various problems in the state but itemised various challenges which the chamber believes that if properly addressed would go a long way in alleviating the discomfort currently being experienced by all in Anambra.  He said roads within the state are in urgent need of repair  and listed such dilapidated roads in the area to include 3-3-Nsugbe, Awka Road, New Market Road, Niger Bridge approach from Onitsha, Niger Street to Main Market, Creek Road, Ochanja Round About to Zik Ave, Oguta Road among others. He said the deplorable condition of the roads had led to traffic gridlock being experienced in Onitsha for some time now, hence the need to speed up the pace of road rehabilitation. The chambers also decried the illegal checkpoints by security operatives in the name of ‘security concern, especially at both Asaba and Onitsha ends of the Niger Bridge. Obieri lamented that at the Asaba end of the Niger Bridge, in particular, commuters are faced with five different sets of security checkpoints at each side of the expressway, all of which a few meters apart.
