By Monica Iheakam Super Falcons duo, Osinachi Ohale and Rasheedat Ajibade have been named in the Best eleven by the Confederation of African Football CAF. The list was released by the CAF Technical Study Group (TSG), following the completion of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations group stage. Ohale was named Woman of the Match following Super Falcons’ impressive 4-0 win against the Swallows of Burundi on Sunday night. She will anchor the defence line to be supported by Zambia’s Lushomo Mweemba with wingbacks in Tunisia’s Samia Aouni and Morocco’s Zineb Redouan completing the defence. Nigeria’s Rasheedat Ajibade, who has been fantastic in the wings, was paired with Cameroon’s Ajara Nchout and Botswana’s Refilwe Thokalele to provide the needed firepower in the flank. Morocco’s inspirational captain, Ghizlane Chebbak is the leading goal scorer at the tournament with three goals to date and she and the classy South African captain from AC Milan Jane Refiloe make up a formidable midfield combination in the heart of the pitch.  South Africa’s consistent goalkeeper, Andile Dlamini was selected as the tournament’s leading goalkeeper, while the impressive attacking qualities of Zambia’s Grace Chanda was also recognised. The TSG is comprised of Clementine Toure (Cote d’Ivoire head coach), Radia Fertoul (Algeria head coach), Jacqui Shipanga (Namibia Technical Director), Shilene Booysen (South Sudan head coach), Mercy Tagoe (Ghana head coach) and Amani Boukare (Tunisia U20 head coach and senior team assistant coach). Nigeria will face Cameroon in the quarterfinal match on Thursday, in a repeat of the 2016 final in Yaounde.
