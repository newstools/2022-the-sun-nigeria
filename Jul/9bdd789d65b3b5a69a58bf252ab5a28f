From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Governor Douye Diri has spoken on his prayers as the chairman of the national campaign council for a PDP victory in Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State. Diri who disclosed this during a surprise rousing welcome organised by PDP members in Bayelsa State at the Peace Park said the victory was due to prayers and hard work by party faithful at the state and the national levels. According to him when naysayers were predicting a loss for the PDP due to the fact that he was made the Chairman of the National Campaign Council of the party, he went to God in Prayers and his prayers were backed by the resolutions of inter-party frictions within the party in Osun. “ God answered our prayers because we challenged him that naysayers were challenging him and not PDP or myself,” he said. Diri while commending the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the security agencies and others involved in the conduct of the Osun election, insisted that the election in Osun was the first properly conducted by the electoral commission in years. Deputy Governor Lawrence Ehrujiakpor explained that the welcome rally was an impromptu venture hidden from the Governor in order to show him how the people of the state appreciated his effort at ensuring the victory of the PDP and Sen Ademola Adeleke in Osun State. He also called on the people of the state to continue to give their undivided support to Gov. Douye Diri for more performance in the years ahead. Earlier in his speech, the Bayelsa PDP chairman, Solomon Agwanana, dismissed the claims of the existence of internal squabble within the party in the state, saying the PDP is more united in Bayelsa than ever. “What is recorded in Osun is the little out of what Governor Diri has recorded. He has not failed the PDP and the people. All members of the PDP in the state must act responsibly. The bond of unity in the PDP is shining and God did what happened in Osun,” he said.
