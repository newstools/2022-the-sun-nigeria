The Athletics Federation of Nigeria, AFN, has described as unfortunate Ezinne Abba’s outburst, blaming the Federation and the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Chief Sunday Dare for her inability to make Team Nigeria’s list to the World Athletics Championships which start on Friday in Oregon, USA. AFN Secretary General, Prince Adisa Adeniyi Beyioku says Abba should know she couldn’t force herself into the team after failing to compete in any individual event at the Nigerian Championships in Benin City last month. “Miss Abba did not compete in any individual event at the Nigerian Championships in Benin City which was used as selection trials for both the World Athletics Championships and the Commonwealth Games. “This means her selection will no longer be on merit but at the discretion of the AFN,” said Beyioku in a statement. The AFN Secretary General says athletes who did not come for the trials or did not compete for whatever reason should know they no longer have automatic tickets to compete either at the World Athletics Championships or the Commonwealth Games.
