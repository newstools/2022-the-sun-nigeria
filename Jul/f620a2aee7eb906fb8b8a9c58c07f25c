By Steve Agbota The Tin Can Island Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) yesterday said it intercepted 300 rounds of live ammunition, one pistol gun and two empty magazines along one suspect at the port. This is even as the command also said it recorded a collection of N274.320 billion revenue in the half year of 2022 and seized 145 kilogram of Colorado (Indian Hemp) concealed in two units of Ridgeline trucks and two units of Toyota Corolla vehicles as well as 206,000 pieces of machetes and among other seizures. Speaking during a press briefing at the Tin Island Ports to showcase the seizures, the Customs Area Controller of the Command, Comptroller, Adekunle Oloyede said the revenue generated between January 1 and June 31, 2022 was a 27.50 increase from last year’s collection of N229.322 within the period under review. According to him, so far, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) valuation has helped the command to achieve an expedited clearance process due to predictability of value-assessment, increase in revenue generation, improved ease of doing business, generation of accurate statistics for Federal Government and a host of others. In the area of enforcement and anti-smuggling activities, he said the command handed over one suspect, one arm pistol gun, two empty magazines and 300 rounds of live ammunition to the DSS for further action.
