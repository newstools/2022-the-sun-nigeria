From Godwin Tsa, Abuja Journalists were barred from covering the testimony of children of the late gospel singer, Osinachi, before a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja. The decision was sequel to an application by the prosecution counsel, Aderonke Imana pursuant to the Provision of Section 156 and Section 158 of the Child Rights Acts. She applied that all other persons that do not fall under this law should vacate the court premises. “By the combined provisions of Section 162 Child Rights Act and Section 209 of the Evidence Act and Section 160 of the Child Rights Act. We are applying that the court should allow the witnesses who are under 18 to give evidence as provided by this law. “Provision of Section 1 and Section 2 sub 1 of the Child Rights Act and Section 158 of the Child Rights Act, we hereby apply to my lord that the child witnesses be brought into the court with a blindfold and also be shielded with a screen in the course of giving their testimony in this court today,” she submitted. Responding, the counsel to Peter Nwachukwu, I.A Aliyu did not object to the oral application. In her short ruling, Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme granted the applications and ordered all those not related to the case to excuse the court, including newsmen. Meanwhile, the case has subsequently been adjourned till October 11, 13, and 14, 2022 for continuation of hearing. The Federal government filed a 23-count charge against the late gospel singer’s husband, Peter Nwachukwu, which borders on domestic violence and homicide. Upon arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to all the allegations that were contained in the charge. The late Osinachi, who died on April 8, 2022, as a result of prolonged assault by her husband, was buried on June 25 at her hometown Isochi Umunneochi in Abia State.
