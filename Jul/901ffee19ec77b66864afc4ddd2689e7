Just like the pressure, the stakes are also high for the Super Falcons as they meet Cameroon in a ‘winner-takes-it-all’ confrontation. The winner of the potentially explosive encounter gets the semi-final ticket of the WAFCON in addition to a World Cup ticket. Just as the stakes are high, the Super Falcons are not lacking in support. Their main backers, Amstel Malta Ultra are spurring them to do more, even as they pummelled Burundi 4-0 – the widest score-line so far in the on-going championship. Senior Brand Manager, Amstel Malta Ultra, Maire Abia-Bassey hails the accomplishment of the Falcons while still asking for more from the duo and their team-mates. As the team go for what is believed to be a major battle today, Abia-Bassey asked that the players should display exceptional resilience as the Cameroonians, whether male or female, are traditionally tough.  A victory also gets the Super Falcons on course for their record-extending 10-time win of the biggest prize in women’s football in Africa.
