From Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri The Catholic community in Borno has been in a festive mood following the episcopal ordination of the first indigene as bishop in the Maiduguri Diocese. Most Rev John Bakeni, an indigene of Shani Local Government, Borno State, and former Maiduguri diocese administrator, was ordained on Thursday in Maiduguri as an auxiliary bishop. He became the first auxiliary bishop in the diocese at an ordination mass attended by about 10 catholic bishops from different parts of the country. Apostolic Nuncio to Nigeria, The Most Rev Antonio Filipazz in his message, said, the appointment of Bakeni was approved by the Pope in April upon the recommendation of the Bishop of Maiduguri Diocese of the church, Bishop Oliver Dashe Doeme. He said he was in Maiduguri previously for the dedication of the Cathedral and later ordination of Bakeni as Diocese administrator. He said the Thursday episcopal ordination made the third significant event in the church. He said these signify growth in the church in Northeast Borno despite the Boko Haram attacks, killings and kidnapping. He charged the newly ordained Bishop not to lord himself over the flocks he was chosen to lead. “You have been chosen by the Lord, consider that you are chosen from among men and appointed on their behalf for those things that pertain to God. The title of Bishop is one of service, not of honour and therefore, a Bishop should strive to benefit others rather than lord’s it over them,” he said. The ordination was attended by Catholic Bishops of Jos Metropolitan, Onitsha Diocese, Keffi, Bauchi, Yola, Jalingo, Panshink dioceses, and leaders of other denominations, among others.
