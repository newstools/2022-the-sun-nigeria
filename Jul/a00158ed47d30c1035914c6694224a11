The Kano State Consumer Protection Council (KSCPC) has confiscated 487 bags of expired flour worth millions of naira in the state.  The Acting Managing Director, KSCPC, Alhaji Baffa Babba-Dan Agundi, who made the disclosure in a statement issued by the council’s spokesman, Musbahu Yakasai, in Kano, yesterday, said that the council was informed by ‘some good citizens’ about the expired flour, which was brought to Dawanau International Grain Market, Kano. He stated that the flour was confiscated, following the raid carried out at a warehouse situated at Dawanau Market, Kano, on Sunday. “We confirmed that the flour had already expired after a laboratory test of some samples,” he said. Babba-Dan Agundi added that the council also confiscated many cartons of expired drinks at the Muhammadu Abubakar Rimi Market, Sabongari, Kano. He further explained that the expired flour and the drinks were evacuated and taken to the council’s warehouse. The acting managing director called on the general public to always check on products’ information before using them. “The council will not relent in its efforts at curtailing the importation and selling of unwanted products in the state,” Babba-Dan Agundi said.
