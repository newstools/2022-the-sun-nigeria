From Obinna Odogwu, Abakaliki A 70-year-old widow in Amauzu Nkpoghoro village, Afikpo, in Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Maria (surname withheld), has been banished from the community for allegedly having sex with  a man of about 30 years. According to sources, the woman was caught by her granddaughter while she was having sex with her boyfriend in her matrimonial bed. It was gathered that Maria’s  granddaughter went to her house to deliver food items when she caught the two lovebirds having sex. Displeased by the ugly scene, she was said to have immediately raised the alarm, alerting villagers. Villagers, who were attracted to the scene, it was gathered, dragged Maria and her lover  out and paraded them around the village. Thereafter, the grandmother was allegedly banished from the community. One of the villagers, Egwu Azubuike, said the woman would have faced greater punishment if her husband were still alive. He noted that the act had brought shame to the widow’s family, adding that she was among the most respected women in the community before the incident. Daily Sun gathered that it was a taboo for a widow to make love on her late husband’s matrimonial bed. It was, however, learnt that the community’s custom demands that any woman who does that must appease the gods with three goats before she could be readmitted to the community.
