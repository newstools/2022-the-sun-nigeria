By  Paul Erewuba Henry Onyekuru is due to arrive in Istanbul today to hold talks with several Super Lig clubs over a possible transfer. The former AS Monaco forward is still contracted to Greek champions Olympiacos, but he does not have a future there after a rather underwhelming campaign last season. Onyekuru has thrice played on loan at Turkish giants Galatasaray. It has now been reported that as many as four top Turkish clubs want to sign him with ambitious Adana Demirspor showing the most interest.
