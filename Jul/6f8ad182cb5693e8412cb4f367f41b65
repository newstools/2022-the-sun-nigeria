From Godwin Tsa, Abuja and Paul Osuyi, Asaba There is disquiet in the camp within the People Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State as an Abuja High Court, yesterday, disqualified its 2023 governorship candidate, Sheriff Francis Oborevwori over discrepancies in his academic certificates. Justice Taiwo Taiwo in his judgment, held that Oborevwori lacked the legal competence to participate in the election. The judge equally held that the suit was meritorious. The  judgment was the outcome of a suit filed before the court by an aggrieved member of the party, Mr. Olorogun Edevbie. He listed PDP and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as defendants in the matter. The plaintiff had among other issues argued that the Defendant was not validly nominated by his party. He submitted that the court that PDP violated both its constitution and the Electoral Guidelines, during its state congress that produced Oborevwori as its flag bearer for the forthcoming gubernatorial election. Edevbie prayed the court to restrain the party from forwarding Oborevwori’s name to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and to also restrain the electoral body from receiving or recognising him as the duly nominated candidate of s the party for the election. He also sought an order to restrain Oborevwori from parading or carrying himself as the governorship candidate of the PDP in the state.
