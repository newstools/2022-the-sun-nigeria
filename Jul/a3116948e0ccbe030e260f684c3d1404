By Bimbola Oyesola   A Christian group, Christ Global Network (CGN), has warned political parties against having the same-faith presidential ticket, saying it would further entrench national division in the country. Addressing the media as part of the group’s annual New Wine/Fresh Fire Conference in Sango Ota, Ogun State, yesterday, the Coordinator of the group who is also the Presiding Bishop of Rhema Christian Church, Bishop Taiwo Akinola, said: “As freeborn and bonafide citizens of this great country, Nigeria, we are deeply concerned about the potential consequences of such an arrangement.  “Nigeria is a multi-religious country of about 220 million people. Hence, in order to be just to all citizens and be seen to be so, noble-hearted politicians should see it as a moral duty to continue to avoid a mono-faith candidature, most especially at the presidential level.  “Our candid advice is that all political parties should jettison all Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian permutations.”
