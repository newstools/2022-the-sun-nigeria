Celebrated German website Transfermarkt updated the market value of players in the Scottish Premiership this week. Glasgow Rangers rising star Calvin Bassey is now valued at ten million euros (approximately N4.34 billion), representing a new career-high for the Nigeria international. Prior to Monday’s update, the Leicester City academy product was rated at one million euros. It is believed that Bassey’s market value has significantly increased after a banner season at Rangers, leading to speculation that he could be poached by clubs in more glamorous leagues. The 22-year-old profited from the absence of the recuperating Leon Balogun by forcing his way into Rangers’ starting lineup, making 46 starts in all competitions over the course of the 2021-2022 season. Bassey is the joint third most valuable player at Rangers, an honour he shares with international teammate Joe Aribo and last season’s Europa League top scorer James Tavernier.  The versatile defender is the third most expensive player in the Scottish Premiership, ranks tenth among Nigerian players and 81st when it comes to 1999-born players. Bassey has two years left on his contract with the Ibrox Stadium outfit.
