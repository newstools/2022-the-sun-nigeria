Following the commitment of his future to the English Premier League outfit, Taiwo Awoniyi hopes to, ‘one day’, feature in Liverpool’s senior setup. The 20-year-old who had two years left on his previous contract was handed an extension on Tuesday – after an impressive 2017-18 campaign away in Belgium with Royal Excel Mouscron. He will, again, be going out on loan having yet to secure a UK work permit. That has, however, not stopped the dreams of the youngster who was snapped from Imperial Soccer Academy in 2015.

It was a bit tough for me to be there alone but I just had to keep on working hard and try as much as possible for the best and work for the success of the team. They stayed in the league. It was a great year for me. “Going from Germany [FSV Frankfurt] to Holland [NEC Nijmegen] and to Belgium [Royal Excel Mouscron] was a big career move for me as a player.
