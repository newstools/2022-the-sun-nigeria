By Lukman Olabiyi Justice  A. A. Akinyemi of the Ogun State High Court, Abeokuta, has resolved an agelong land dispute between two families in the state. The families had been at loggerheads over a large parcel of land in the Igboko community, in the Lusada area of Igbesa, Ado-Odo, Local Government Area. Justice Akinyemi, in the matter with Suit No HCT/54/99 between Chief Moshood Adisa Dada, Chief Olabode Itu, Alfa Rasheed Dada and Alibit Itu for themselves and on behalf members of Taiwo Agba Oje Family against Sunday Agugu, Folorunsho Padonu, Israel Buko and three others, ordered Agba Oje Family to take procession of the land in question. The Agba Oje Family, who are the claimants, in their prayers before the court, sought amongst others relief as: “A declaration that they are  entitled to the statutory right of occupancy over the land, an order of recovery of possession, N20, 000.00 damages against the first to third defendants, and a perpetual injunction restraining the defendants, whether by themselves, their servants, agents or privies from doing anything or act, whatsoever, on the said land. The judge, while delivering his judgement,  resolved the sole question for determination in favour of the claimants. The judge, therefore, ordered that the claimants were entitled to the statutory right of occupancy over and in respect of that piece or parcel of land, situate, lying and being at Igboko Igbesa Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government area of Ogun State of Nigeria.
