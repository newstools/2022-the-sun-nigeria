Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, has said his victory in the July 16 governorship election would be so sweet that the opposition will have no choice than to congratulate him. Oyetola said with the love and support of the electorate for him and the All Progressives Congress (APC), nothing could stop his re-election. He said this during an engagement programme with Osun chapter of United Nigeria Panel Beater Association, yesterday, in Akoda, Ede East Local Council Development Area of the state. Represented by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, the governor said with the available meagre resources, he had put smiles on the faces of the people in the state. He said his achievements in various sectors in the state in more than three years in office will speak for him, and ensure his re-election. Oyetola, who commended the people for the support given to his administration since inception, urged them not to allow greedy politicians to destroy the giants strides the state had made. The governor said governance was for serious-minded people and not for those who lacked administrative capacity. Oyetola said the massive defeat suffered by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other opposition parties in Ekiti election, would be repeated in the state in a greater dimension. “With the massive support from the electorate, my victory in July 16 will be so sweet that the opposition will be left with no option than to congratulate me. “The overwhelming support from the electorate for me and APC is enough testimony that the opposition parties have lost before the election,” he said. Oyetola said his administration would never be distracted by political machinations, but rather focus on quality service delivery to the people. The governor said he would not spare any effort in advancing the pace of good governance, which his administration had instituted for the masses, after his re-election.
