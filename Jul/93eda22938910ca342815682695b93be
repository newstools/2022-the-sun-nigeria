From Molly Kilete, Abuja Gunmen have kidnapped the District Head of Kuchibuyi community, Malam Isiaka Dauda. Kuchibuyi is located in Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The gunmen suspected to be bandits, numbering over 15, were said to have stormed the village at about 12 midnight on Sunday, and shot sporadically to scare residents of the community before abducting the monarch, who was at his private residence near the palace. It was gathered that the kidnappers may have got information that the royal father was not in the palace at the time they struck, as they were said to have conducted a search, from room to room, before they found him. The vigilance group in the community were said to have been overpowered by the armed bandits as they watched them leaving with their traditional ruler, using a separate route that links to Bwari town. The FCT police command was yet to react to the abduction of the traditional ruler as the command’s Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, did not pick her call at the time of filing this report.
