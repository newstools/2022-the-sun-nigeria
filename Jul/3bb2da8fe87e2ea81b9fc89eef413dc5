Progress is being made on the Lagos-Abidjan Corridor and on issues around the movement of goods and service, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has said. His spokesman, Laolu Akande, in a statement in Abuja, said the vice president spoke with newsmen after the 61st Ordinary Session of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held in Accra, Ghana. The Lagos- Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway is part of the Trans-African Highway within the ECOWAS region. Osinbajo said that at meeting, President Sissoco Embaló of Guinea-Bissau assumed chairmanship of the West African regional body, ECOWAS, alongside a newly composed Commission. He said there were high expectations regarding the output of the body and the leaders must work harder to resolve lingering issues in the region. “President Nana Akufo-Addo did an excellent job in a very challenging period in the history of ECOWAS and many of the challenges remain. “So, we expect that the new leadership will take over and work as hard and perhaps much harder to resolve some of the issues. There are even additional challenges today – economic challenges, especially with the Russian-Ukraine crisis, and economic problems. Other issues are the coups that have taken place in the region in the past couple of years and we are still trying to resolve some of those issues.”
