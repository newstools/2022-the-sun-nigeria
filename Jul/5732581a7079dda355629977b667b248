From Aloysius Attah, Onitsha  A group, Igbo Youths for Positive Change, yesterday, said passage of the 2022 revised budget by the Anambra House of Assembly has shown that the lawmakers are in support of Governor Charles Soludo’s mission to turn the state to a liveable and prosperous homeland.  National President of the group, Chinedu Obigwe, who commended the lawmakers in a statement in Awka, said the smooth passage of the budget has shown light will always triumph over darkness.  He thanked Obinna Emenaka, House Committee chairman on appropriation for the role he played to ensure the passage of the budget and Speaker Uchenna Okafor for ensuring members of the House of Assembly puts the interests of Anambra above their personal interests.  “The speaker has demonstrated uncommon leadership qualities. He has shown capacity and competence in the discharge of his duties as the Assembly speaker. Enemies of progress have been put to shame because they never expected the revised budget to be passed easily by the House members,” he said. As for the recent loan request sent to the House for approval by Soludo, Obigwe said there is nothing wrong with it. “Governor Soludo is not someone that is reckless in the management of resources and it’s obvious he has the burning desire to turn Anambra to a liveable and prosperous homeland,” he said.
