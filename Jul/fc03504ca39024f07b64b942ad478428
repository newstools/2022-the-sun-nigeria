For co-founder/CEO of NextXtar, Qris Chinedu Ebeatu, his passion for discovering new talents had informed the establishment of the online music distribution platform. According to him, NextXtar has simplified the approach to music distribution, licensing and publishing worldwide, and has achieved this through a user-friendly dashboard that allows artistes upload their contents free of charge. Qris explained further that NextXtar is supported by major global digital music and social media platforms such as UDUX, Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, Tidal, Amazon, Instagram, Tik Tok, Deezer, Vevo, and Facebook (Meta). “The NextXtar platform also gives the artistes the opportunity to compete for fabulous prizes, attract more fans, and judge how people perceive their art. While the NextXtar radio gives subscribers the opportunity to listen to the music uploaded by NextXtar’s artistes and labels. “NextXtar’s purpose is not only to ease digital music distribution in Africa and beyond but also to assist with the marketing and promotion of the artistes and their songs. NextXtar will add videos to the platform, which will allow creatives to upload and share viral videos on the platform with subscribers, street teams, and beyond,” Ebeatu said.
