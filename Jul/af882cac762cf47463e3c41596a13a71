On Friday July 22, one of the pillars of Nigeria’s high society, Sisi Abah Folawiyo will clock 80. To celebrate the milestone birthday, his beloved son, Segun Awolowo as well as close friends of the super fashion matron, are already gearing up to paint Lagos red with one-of-its-kind celebrations. The remarkable life of the super socialite has always been a subject of perpetual fascination as she established herself in Nigeria as a fashion icon to cheer. She is one of the iconic names that headlined the Nigerian fashion industry back in the ‘70s, spearheading a fashion revolution that embraced the beauty of our local ankara fabric that has, today, become a favourite for all. Due to her peerless charm and remarkable presence, Sisi Abah —as many fondly called her— makes a mark on everyone she meets. Despite the seeming rollercoaster life, she has continued to show great resilience. Though approaching the eighth floor, the grand dame shows no signs of slowing down. It is not surprising, therefore, that others are honoured to have made her acquaintance in times past and are willing to turn the country on its head as they celebrate her 80th birthday. Born and raised in Ghana, Sisi Abah (as many call her) is from a lineage of remarkable dress makers. She relocated to Nigeria, and has since then remained a style icon. Her love stories have been one of the most fascinating things about the elegant dame.
