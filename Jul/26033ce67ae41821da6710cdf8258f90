The UK Government said it was extending partnership and support to Nigerian Government, civil society and media to launch a campaign aimed at raising awareness on illicit finance. The British High Commission in Nigeria in a statement on Thursday, said that the campaign was tagged ‘ProtectWhatsYours’. It said the campaign, would be seen on TV and online to highlight the detrimental and long lasting effects that illegal financial activity was having on communities and Nigeria’s entire economy. According to the statement, It is estimated that illicit financial crimes cost every Nigerian about  N35,000 for each year of their life, and robs the population of about 18 billion dollars annually. “Financial crime directly impacts upon the development and economic growth of Nigeria, with the monies lost each year being diverted away from key areas for sector growth; including infrastructure, technology, the health and education sector. “The #ProtectWhatsYours campaign seeks to encourage Nigerians to recognise and report financial crime in their immediate environment. “It also calls on Nigerians in the diaspora to report from around the world, where assets can be located, ” it said.
