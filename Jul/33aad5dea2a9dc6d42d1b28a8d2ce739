The Presidential Candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has criticised the attempt by the present government of President Muhammadu Buhari to force the RUGA policy sown the throat of Nigerians, saying RUGA is a state affairs.   He said, “In arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party including our governors, the national working committee, board of trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom.” “In these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment’s notice, that is, a president-in-waiting. “In other words, the person must have the qualities to be President. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless All Progressives Congress government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understands the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.” He  spoke on Arise Television programme Morning Show  on Friday saying RUGA is a state issue  and that it will be left for the states to handle. For instance, he said: “I have 1,000, cattle but non has crossed the shores of Adamawa State Under his watch, he said, every part of the country will be given a sense of belong criticising the present situation where Nigeria has 17 security agencies and all the heads of the agencies are from on part of the country. Atiku Abubakar, said he did not pick Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, as his running mate because he wanted someone he could work with “amicably”.   Details soon…
