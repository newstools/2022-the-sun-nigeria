Fast rising comedian, Oghenekowhoyan Onaibe Desmond popularly known as Destalker, has recalled his days of humble beginning. According to the 2021 Humour Awards’ Comedian of the Year, “I laugh hard when I hear people say I came out of nowhere to become who I am today. I have been in Lagos for almost 14 years doing comedy, but grace finally found me about four years ago; and now I’m the Destalker everyone knows.” The rib cracker continued: “Before relocating to Lagos, I used to work as an undertaker for a funeral home back in Enugu State. I was popular with the name Desmond Onaibe. In those days, my dancing skills while being an undertaker also gave me fame. I simply made dance a means to make both ends meet, and I tried to put in my best. Whatever situation you are in, it is a process you need to pass through to get to your promised land.” Destalker gave more insights into his upcoming event tagged: ‘Destalker Laughter Crusade’ coming up on August 7. “It will be one of the biggest comedy events to happen this year. Destalker Laughter Crusade as the name implies is more than a comedy show, it’s a crusade experience. We will be having two shows, one on the red carpet and the other in the main Eko Hotel hall. It promises to be all shades of fun and excitement as Alibaba, AY, Gordons, Gbenga Adeyinka and many other greats will be present. There will also be musical performances from Sparkle Tee, Tuface, Reminisce and a surprise act.”
