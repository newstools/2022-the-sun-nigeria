The Plateau State Contributory Healthcare Management Agnecy (PLASCHEMA) has said that the data of its beneficiaries are intact and well secured Dr Fabong Jemchang, the Director General of the agency, said this at a press conference on Saturday in Jos. Jemchang was reacting to a publication by some online media platforms , alleging data breach in the agency. The DG maintained that the agency places high premium on the security of the data of its beneficiaries and described the allegations as ”fake and malicious”. ”Sequel to recent reports that emerged on some online platforms on July 20, alleging data breach of beneficiaries of PLASCHEMA, i hereby categorically states that the data of all our beneficiaries are secured and intact. ”It is important to point out that the claim by Website Planet to have discovered beneficiaries’ information in the open during their web mapping project does not hold. ”We place a very high premium on the data of our beneficiaries and do not for any reason condone unwarranted access to the personal data of beneficiaries, ”he said. Jemchang, however, said that the agency would not rest until it unravelled any malicious third party ,attempting to undo the agency. He commended Mr Daser David, the Director General of the Plateau State ICT Development Agency (PICTDA), whose team has worked with the agency from its inception to ensure that its systems were properly set up alongside its technology operations. ”We wish to enjoin all residents of Plateau to key into the health insurance scheme as it eliminates out- of-pocket spending. ”At PLASCHEMA, our goal is to ensure that no one is left behind,” Jemchang said.(NAN)
