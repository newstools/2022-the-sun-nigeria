By Daniel Kanu National Leader, Ijaw Monitoring Group (IMG), Comrade Joseph Evah, has counseled the leadership of the Southeast region to re-examine the position of the region on the sit-at-home order by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), stressing that such action would negatively affect the 2023 presidential bid of their illustrious son, Peter Obi. He also asked the South East region to look beyond President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure as his office term would soon be over, adding, “Whether sit-at-home or not, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will come out a hero.” Evah made these observations in a chat with Sunday Sun, urging the leadership of the southeast geopolitical zone to concentrate more on the post-Buhari agenda, rather than lose focus “with distraction of the moment, by the government of the day that has not been in their favour.” His words: “Sincerely speaking, the sit-at-home order is largely injurious to the region, economically and in all the areas you may want to examine it, including the present presidential bid of their son, Peter Obi, who is changing the political climate with his movement. The situation will soon begin to work against him because what the Igbo needs now is to embrace others not making your area incommunicado. “Southeast elders need to be strategic in their thinking, even though some of them need to be taken to Enugu where we have enough coal deposit and rub their faces with charcoal in shame.
