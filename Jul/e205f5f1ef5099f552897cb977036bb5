By Bunmi Ogunyale Nigerian international, Moses Simon’s name and other Nigerian stars are conspicuously missing on CAF’s star-studded final list of nominees for the men’s categories of the CAF Awards 2022, with some of the elite performers in the last few months making the top list. Simon and Akinwunmi Amao were the only two Nigerians nominated in a 60-man shortlist released last week for individual awards in the 2022 CAF Awards. Nigerians Rashidi Yekini, Emmanuel Amuneke, Victor Ikpeba and Nwankwo Kanu had won the award previously and Napoli forward Victor Osimhen was touted to be among but was surprisingly omitted from the 60-man shortlist. Amao, who plays for FC Copenhagen, was listed in the 10-man shortlist for CAF’s Young Player of the Year category but his name has been yanked off the latest release. It may however not be a blanket year for Nigeria as Asisat Oshoala might likely be nominated in the women’s category when the shortlist is finally released. Oshoala will be going for a record fifth as Africa’s best female footballer. The CAF Awards 2022 will be held in Rabat, Morocco on July 21, 2022. The 10-man list includes reigning CAF African Player of the Year, Sadio Mane (Senegal and Bayern Munich), former winner Riyad Mahrez (Algeria and Manchester City), Mohamed Salah (Egypt and Liverpool), amongst others.
