By Steve Agbota                 The African Association of Professional Freight Forwarders and Logistics of Nigeria (APFFLON) has taken a bold step with the opening of its South African annex. APFFLON President, Otunba Frank Ogunojemite concluded this plan in South Africa last week where he engaged the inaugural members and executives of the association. Speaking on this development, Ogunojemite said that the deliberations where fruitful even as he noted that the South African Chapter had obtained the nation’s certificate of corporation.  “The focus of APFFLON is to optimize the gains of this profession across the continent. To achieve this we need to support of all associations and practitioners in several African nations. “In Nigeria, we need support from the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN) and other relevant Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs), among others,” he said. According to him, the goal of APFFLON is similar to the ideals propagated in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the association is keen to promote freight forwarding and trade among African nations. He said that the association is making similar moves to open an annex in Ghana which is expected to be concluded in the next few weeks. Ogunojemite identified Ethiopia and Cameroon as other nations where freight agents are already in top gear with regards preparation for the launch of the association. He, however, encouraged more African nations to indicate interest in the association which is more concerned about addressing the welfare of freight forwarding practitioners and creating an environment for seamless practice than monetary benefits for its leaders.
