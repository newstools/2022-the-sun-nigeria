By Lawrence Enyoghasu Ogun State Police Command has arrested the duo of Adetunji Alagbe and Opeyemi Ogunlokun for stealing a Sallah ram belonging to one Sodiq Abolore. The state Police Public Relation Officer, Abimbola, in a statement, yesterday, said the suspects were arrested following a report lodged at Ogijo divisional headquarters by Sodiq Abolore, “Abolore reported that while he was sleeping in his house at about 3am, he heard an unusual noise in his compound which made him peep through the window, only to discover that the iron gate he used to block the entrance where he kept his Sallah ram had been pulled down. “This made him come out and discovered that his Sallah ram, which he bought for N120,000 was no longer there. He stated further that when he searched around, he saw three men forcing his ram into a waiting Mazda car booth, which made him raise the alarm, and a distress call was made to the police. “The three men were chased and two of them were apprehended, while the other one escaped. The ram was recovered and the two suspects were taken to custody,” Oyeyemi stated. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered an in-depth investigation of the case, with a view of charging the suspects to court as soon as possible.
