The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday dismissed appeals filed by the Russian soccer federation and four Russian clubs against FIFA and UEFA’s decision to ban them from all competition until further notice following the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Global soccer’s governing body FIFA and European soccer’s governing body UEFA decided in February that all Russian teams, whether national or club sides, would be suspended from participation in FIFA and UEFA competitions after the invasion, which Moscow calls a “special military operation”. In March, CAS rejected a request from the Russian soccer federation (FUR) to freeze FIFA’s suspension, effectively ending its hopes of competing at the World Cup in Qatar. Later in May, Russian Premier League clubs Zenit St. Petersburg, Dynamo Moscow, FC Sochi and CSKA Moscow filed an appeal against UEFA.
