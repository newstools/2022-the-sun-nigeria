From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Governorship candidate of Action People’s Party (APP) in Abia State, Mascot Uzor Kalu, has picked a university don, Prof Osondu Akoma, as his running mate in the 2023 election.  This is even as a socio-political group, Ngwa United Alliance (NUA), has hailed his choice of Prof Akoma. A statement from the party expressed the confidence that the emergence of Akoma, who is from Ukwa bloc of Abia South Senatorial District, as the running mate to Mascot Kalu would secure the party victory in the gubernatorial election. “We are now fully ready for the electoral battle in 2023. Mascot Kalu is a force in the governorship race, because he is from Abia North; a Catholic with his mother a Presbyterian and an Anglican deputy from a marginalised Ukwa bloc. This ticket is the most solid in Abia State and by the Grace of God, it will end in praise. Abia is going to be APP,” the part said. Meanwhile, speaking in Umuahia, a leading member of NUA, Chief Apollos Jacob described Akoma as a thorough bred academic, who over the years, had deployed his experience to the development of humanity. He expressed confidence that APP’s choice of Akoma as running mate to Mascot Kalu would ensure victory for the party. “On behalf of Ngwa United Alliance , I want to express my unreserved gratitude to Mascot Kalu for standing by his words of ensuring that a credible leader from Ukwa Ngwa emerged as running candidate of the party for the coming elections in 2023,” he said.
