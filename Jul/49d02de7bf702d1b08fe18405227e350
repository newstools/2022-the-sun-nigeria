From Noah Ebije, Kaduna People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees (BoT) Chairman Walid Jibrin has said that Senator Ademola Adeleke’s victory in Saturday’s Osun State governorship election did not come as a surprise, adding that he was optimistic about a PDP victory. Second Republic Senator Jibrin, in a statement said he had before the election assured the governor-elect of winning the election. He congratulated Senator Ademola Adeleke over his victory at the just concluded governorship election. “I was there at Osun during the last campaign and the number of people that turned out for the rally was unbelievable and I was so sure that the PDP will win Osun State,” he stated. “And this is just the beginning of victory. What has happened in Osun State now is an indication of PDP’s stand in the whole country. We as a party have learned our lessons and the Yoruba are beginning to learn their lessons too, by coming out to elect Chief Adeleke. We are rest assured that other states in western Nigeria will be won by the PDP come 2023. “By the grace of God, all other states in the country will vote for us. So the issue of the APC campaign for a Muslim-Muslim presidency will not work. You can bear witness that it didn’t work in Osun State, so we should not support this kind of politics. “Our concern should be based on who is the best candidate for us that can be in charge of the country.” The PDP Board of Trustees Chairman decried politics of religion, describing it as the highest level of division among citizens, adding that it is capable of breeding confusion and war on a people that have been existing peacefully.
