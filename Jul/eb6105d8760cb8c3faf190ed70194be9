Italian transfer market expert Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Nigeria international Umar Sadiq could be heading to Villarreal in the summer transfer window. The Yellow Submarine are targeting the Almeria man as a potential replacement for another Nigerian-born attacker in Arnaut Danjuma, who is heavily linked with a transfer to West Ham United. Romano has tweeted that the Hammers are progressing in talks with Villarreal to sign Danjuma for a fee of a little under forty five million euros and the Premier League side want him to be one of their marquee signings this summer. Sadiq’s potential transfer to Villarreal is not straightforward with the striker linked with a big five La Liga club Sevilla and other top European clubs. Sevilla sporting director Monchi knows Sadiq as they spent time together at AS Roma. Over the  last few weeks, Ajax Amsterdam and Benfica have been credited with an interest in the 2016 Olympics bronze medalist. Although Sadiq is a key player for Almeria, the Rojiblancos would be forced to sell their prized jewel if they receive a bid of 25 million euros.
