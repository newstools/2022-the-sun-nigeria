From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja House of Representatives has approved a bill seeking to remove staff of the National Assembly Service Commission from Contributory Pension Scheme. The bill, which scaled its second reading was also considered at the  Committee of the Whole, yesterday, and seeks to establish the National Assembly Pensions Board. The proposed legislation entitled: “Bill for an Act to Amend the Pension Reform Act, 2014 to Exclude/Exempt the National Assembly Service from the Contributory Pension Scheme and Establish the National Assembly Service Pension Board; and for Related Matters ,” is sponsored by the chairman, House Committee on National Planning and Economy Development, Olododo Cook.

The retirement benefits of personnel referred to in subsection 2 shall be adjusted to be commensurate with the provisions of this Bill. There shall be charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation, all such sums of money as may, from time to time, be granted by the Federal Government by way of pension and gratuity in accordance with this Bill.” Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, in his  remarks, said the proposed legislation is essential as it would enhance the autonomy of the federal legislature.
