From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri There was a heavy pandemonium on Thursday when street traders at the popular Douglas road, Owerri confronted the officials of the Imo State Environmental Transformation Commission (ENTRACO) and their security agents guarding them when the latter was enforcing a relocation order issued by the State governor, Hope Uzodimma few months ago. The adamant traders who were asked to relocate to a better places provided for them hauled stones at the ENTRACO officials and security agents who in turn fired sporadically rubber bullets to scare them away. But rather than retreating,the traders in their numbers attacked the officials and in the ensuing fracas passerby ignorant of what was happening ran helter skelter for safety. However, no casualty was recorded in the incident except for few people who fell while running away hearing the sound of gunshots even as the adamant street traders returned back to their stands when the officials left.
