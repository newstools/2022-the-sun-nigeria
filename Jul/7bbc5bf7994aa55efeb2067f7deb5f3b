From Fred Ezeh, Abuja The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) has announced a grant for Grand Africa Initiative (GAIN) a pan-African non-governmental organisation enabling African youths through training, empowerment, mentorship, and advocacy, to train 200 young Africans on entrepreneurship and intra-African trade for a three-month period starting July 2022. The GAIN-Afreximbank Masterclass on Entrepreneurship and Intra-African Trade is a three-month programme designed to equip participants from across Africa with skills to grow and expand their businesses across borders. Executive Director of GAIN, Chinwe Okoli, in a statement, on Monday, confirmed that faculty of experts from around the world have been arranged to provide technical advisory and financial lessons to the successful applicants that would participate in the training. She said that participants, in addition to that, would also gain key insights on existing business opportunities, while developing trade finance management skills that are integral for building partnerships that leverage the opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). “The programme will also broaden inclusiveness in the implementation of the AfCFTA through interventions that support young Africans, women, and small and medium-sized enterprises. “This is the second in a series of GAIN Entrepreneurship Masterclass designed to empower African youths. The first edition held in 2021 benefitted youths from 13 countries across Africa. But beyond the training, the participants would have access to a unique community of like-minds for accountability and sustained motivation,” she stated. She encouraged interested entrepreneurs to apply for the programme via www.grandafrica.org or www.bit.ly/GAINAFREXIM2, adding that applicants must have a registered business that must have been in operation for two years and above, must also be based in Africa and must be owned by youths of African descent.
