By Lawrence Enyoghasu Rotary Club of Satellite Town, District 9110, has said that to cushion the effect of floods in the state, residents must embrace the act of tree planting, while the state government should crack down on violators of the Tree Planting Act. The club made this plea yesterday, through the president, Dickson Chidiebere while marking International Tree Planting Day which was held at the Police Children School, Satellite Town, Lagos. “Lagos state is congested enough. It is a state that is habouring many people which means lots of carbon dioxide. we need trees to breathe in this gas for us. A tree can provide oxygen for six people comfortably    There are countless advantages of tree planting aside from job opportunities. It can also help curb the flooding we are facing in this state,” he stated. Chairman Oriade Local Council Development Area Ramotalai Olarenwaju Akinlola Hassan stated that though the culture of tree planting reduced a little, the council has rejuvenated the culture and planned to plant more trees in the year. “It would also serve as beautification for the state. The culture had reduced because the past governor had other priorities but the recent one, Sanwo-Olu Babatunde, is big on tree planting. We have said this before and we are saying it again, anybody caught destroying trees or flowers would face the law. It is criminal to fell a tree and cut off a flower,” she stated. Speaking on the sustainability of the project, Committee Chairperson, Vera Nwagu said that the teachers and students have been trained on how to care for the trees and flowers.
