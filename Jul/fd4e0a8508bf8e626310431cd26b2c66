By Zika Bobby ANTI Oil Theft Sensitisation Initiative (AOTSI) has called on the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Lucky Irabor, for collaboration and synergy to end the menace of oil thieves in the downstream oil industry in the Niger Delta region. He said only such partnership could bring an end to the menace.  Its National Coordinator, Abraham Ekokotu, in a letter to the defence chief, said Nigerian oil industry has suffered in the hands of the criminals. Ekokotu bemoaned the activities of oil and gas facilities vandals and product thieves who, he said, readily find markets for stolen petroleum products in the country, stating that until such measures, as collaboration with critical stakeholders, are put in place, the illicit trade in the industry won’t abate soon.  The former militant leader, who is at the forefront of ending oil theft and sundry crimes in the country’s oil industry, said he leads a group that has the mandate to sensitise and enlighten the Delta population on the dangers inherent in allowing the illicit trade in stolen products to thrive as he called on the youths to shun oil theft and embrace legitimate business. He said stealing of petroleum products is a serious crime against the state punishable by long jail term, stressing that such act depletes the wealth of the nation and also inimical to the growth and development of the Niger Delta region. He noted that the security agencies are not responsible to workable intelligence which forms the reason for the call on the highest security boss in the country for intervention in a synergy with AOTSI to end the menace, stressing that until such collaboration is formed the illicit trade will continue. He alleged that some security agents are hands-in-glove with oil thieves and this, it noted, also informed the call for concerted efforts at ending the era of criminality in the downstream oil industry within and outside of the Delta region while he called for an authority from the defence headquarters for the group to have unfettered access to the army and navy whenever the need arises. He said most credible intelligence gathered by the group and reported to some agencies got leaked to the operators of illegal businesses in oil theft.
