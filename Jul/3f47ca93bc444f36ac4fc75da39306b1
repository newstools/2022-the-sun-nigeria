By Bolaji Okunola Eko Centennial Lions Club, Lagos, has called on Nigerians to use their influence and effluence to serve and uplift the less privileged in the society. It pleaded with well meaning Nigerians to invest in programmes that would promote the cause of humanity. President of the club, Lukman Olabiyi, made the call when he led members to donate relief materials to the inmates at the Lagos State Rehabilitation and Training Centre, Owutu, Agric, Ikorodu, to mark the beginning of new Lion’s year, which commenced on July 1. He said: “Lions Club understands its roles in the society, and it will continue to give helping hands to the needy. He also urged the three tiers of government to be more committed to the cause of the less privileged: “Kindness is free, let’s give it; it is only when we give that we get more; giving is living. If God has raised our standards of living, let’s raise the standards of our giving. “Let all wealthy Nigerians come and join the Lions Club International to give back to the society. It is a place to serve the needy whole-heartedly. There are so many people seeking our help, we should rise up to help. “Ours is a commitment to humanitarian services in our communities. We are passionate about the causes of the less privileged and the commoners in our communities.” Olabiyi implored Nigerians to jettison the perception that someone needed to be a millionaire before he or she could join Lions Club: “Anyone who can afford to buy bottle of soft drinks and share among people is qualified to be a member of the club.” Official of the centre, Mr  Arole  Olamide, who received the relief materials on behalf of the inmates, thanked the club for its kind gesture and sought for more support.
