From Fred Ezeh, Abuja  There was pandemonium in Wuse 2 area of Abuja on Friday, as armed robbers numbering about 30 invaded a compound of about 15 flats located at Agadez Crescent, Wuse 2, Abuja in the early hours. About ten flats were successfully robbed. An eyewitness indicated that the robbers invaded the compound at about 2:30am and operated for several hours uninterrupted. She said: “Aside phones, cash and lots of household items that they took, some of the residents were injured by the armed robbers. A man who was supposed to travel to the United States on Friday night was stabbed after he was dispossessed of 10, 000 dollars that he was supposed to travel with. “When the stabbed man pretended to have died, they dragged him towards the gate and abandoned him there and continued their operations. Immediately, the man regained energy and strength, and saw that they had left him, he rushed out to seek help from armed soldiers attached to a nearby house, but the soldiers allegedly ignored him. He was ignored by policemen attached to a nearby commercial bank. Our joy was that no one was kidnapped.” When contacted, the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, confirmed the robbery attack but also confirmed that all the items stolen were recovered. She said: “Police mobilised immediately they got the distress call. They gave the robbers a hot chase which made them to drop all they stolen.”
