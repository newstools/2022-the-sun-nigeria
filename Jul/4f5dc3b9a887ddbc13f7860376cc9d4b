From Noah Ebije, Kaduna   A chieftain of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chinedum Ezebuiro, has said votes will not count in 2023 general elections because the rich have deprived the masses of the basic necessities of life in order to manipulate them during the elections. Ezebuiro also said that God’s candidate will emerge in 2023 to defeat other candidates like Bola Ahmed Tinubu of All Progressive Congress (APC), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Peter Obi of Labour Party (LP). The detribalised politician who has been in the political arena since 1992/1993 under the SDP said God’s candidate will save the country from bad governance, poverty, insecurity and hunger through divine intervention.
