From Molly Kilete, Abuja There are reports that another Boko Haram terrorists who escaped from Kuje prison during last Tuesday’s attack has been arrested. Daily Sun gathered that the suspect, said to be a top commander of the terrorists group, was arrested by police operatives from the Gwagwalada divisions. A police source told Daily Sun that the police have recovered over 500 prisoners who escaped from the facility during last Tuesday’s attack. The source said over 400 suspects were recovered last Wednesday after the attack, while the rest were rearrested in the last few days. “Our men have been combing the forest and we were able to arrest over 400 escapees on Wednesday; and, as of today, we have arrested over 500 of them. This one that was arrested in Gwagwalada was on Sunday morning, and when we profiled him, we discovered he is a top commander of the Boko Haram terrorists group, and he has been cooperating with information during interrogation.” The source, who did not want to be mentioned in print, told Daily Sun that the police have been combing the forests in the Federal Capital Territory and its environs, especially places where the criminals were hibernating and smoking them out. The source said the police were working in conjunction with farmers, hunters, vigilantes and other local groups, to fish out the criminals who escaped from the prison facility in the forests. It was gathered that for days now, police operatives, comprising personnel of the Intelligence Response Team, Counter Terrorism, Special Task Team, Anti Riot Police and other operatives, have been combing the forest linking the FCT with Niger and Kogi states. When contacted, the FCT Police Command Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, promised to get back to the reporter, but did not at the time of filing this report.
