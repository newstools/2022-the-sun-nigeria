Super Eagles striker and captain, Ahmed Musa, has expressed his dissatisfaction and disappointment with Nigerian leaders over their lackadaisical approach to the ongoing ASUU strike. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has been at loggerheads with the government over the welfare and running of Nigerian Universities for over twenty years. And the status quo has remained unchanged with every government. ASUU embarked on a one-month warning strike in February. And they had claimed that before the strike, they had reached out to the government but the Muhammadu Buhari-led government did not take them seriously. It is now July, and almost five months since tertiary institutions have been on lockdown, and all that has come out of the incessant ‘talks’ and ‘negotiations’ is nothing. The Fatih Karagumruk forward, Musa, took to Instagram to weigh in on the issue, criticising the political office holders for their poor attitude. Ahmed Musa’s Instagram post; “To our political office holders whose children school abroad.  “How do you feel visiting your children abroad, taking pictures in their schools, and posting online while ASUU is on strike?  “You’re running a system that you don’t believe in. Show me one Oyibo leader whose child is schooling in Nigeria. E no dey touch una?  “And when you return, Nigerian youths will still gather and sing praises for you.”
