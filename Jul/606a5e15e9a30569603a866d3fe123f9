From Fred Itua, Abuja Supporters of All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Bola Ahmed Tinubu referred to the party’s loss last weekend in Osun State as a “big lesson”. The supporters, who are members of Bola Ahmed Tinubu National Canvassers (BATNC), expressed to reporters in Abuja on Wednesday that the presidential candidate will deliver in 2023. The president of the support group, Murtala Muhammad Garba, while making a strong case for Tinubu, urged supporters to get their permanent voters’ cards. “We must be able to represent our candidate, anywhere, anywhere, anytime in this country and outside. Let the electorate know that our candidate is a good example of good governance,” he stated. “He has been doing it and he will do more if given the opportunity to govern. He has a road map. He lives in Nigeria and his businesses are here, too, in the country. “He believes in the empowerment of youths and women. He participated and contributed to many developmental projects within the country. Let out campaign convince the electorate out there. “What happened in Osun State is a big lesson to all support groups and party loyalists. Let us build bridges and not walls. The time of box snatching is gone. “The electorate now vote for individuals and not a party. We need to defend the reason for the emergence of a Muslim as the vice president [candidate],” he said.
