From Damilola Fatunmise   Nasarawa State Governor, Abdulahi Sule, has said the choice of former Borno State governor, Kashim Shetimma, as running mate to Bola Tinubu would not pose a threat to the ruling All progressives Congress (APC) winning next year’s presidential poll. Sule, who spoke in a television programme monitored in Lagos, yesterday, said the Muslim-Muslim ticket of Tinubu and Shetimma enjoyed the backing of Christians within the APC. He said Shettima’s choice was based on his experience as a banker and former governor who had the experience of taking on Boko Haram. He said the APC Presidential candidate knew the ability of his running mate to deliver results before choosing him. “If he has taken any Christian, people who will still talk. Being a Muslim-Muslim ticket or Muslim-Christian ticket, the best thing is to work with the person that shares your vision and who is ready to work with you.  Senator Shettima is an old member of APC, he’s been there and he knows the rules, he’s bold, he’s not afraid, he believes in the economy; all these factors made it possible for him to be seen to run this race with Tinubu. Many top strong Christians who are still members of the party that are working with them. So many Christians leader came out today to show their support for Senator Shettima without being biased.” The Nasarawa governor said the presidential  race is more than religion sentiments and that all party members were working for the victory of Tinubu. When asked §bout the Osun State governorship election where the party lost, Sule said the outcome which favoured the PDP would not affect the APC winning the presidential election.
