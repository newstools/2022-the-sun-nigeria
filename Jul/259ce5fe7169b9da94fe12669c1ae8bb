From Lateef Dada, Osogbo Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State, yesterday said the All Progressives Congress (APC) is confident of winning the Saturday governorship election having toured the 30 local governments and secured the support of traditional rulers and people of the state. Chief Press secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, who is also a member of the campaign committee told Daily Sun in Osogbo, the Oyo State capital that God has been supporting Governor Oyetola because he has always  relied on almighty. He said, “with the show of love received during the campaign, our victory is sure.” Oyetola concluded the campaign tour on Friday when he visited Ife South Local Government to seek reelection from the people. Omipidan said, “any political observer would know that the governor received overwhelming welcome in all the 30 local governments with prayers and adoption by traditional rulers.” He noted that some traditional rulers in the West zSenatorial District had endorsed Oyetola after which the Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdur-Rasheed Akanbi, organized a prayer and promised total support for the governor. Omipidan said the recent endorsement of over 20,000 students is a pointer to the fact that the people of the state have resolved to reelect Oyetola for a second term.
