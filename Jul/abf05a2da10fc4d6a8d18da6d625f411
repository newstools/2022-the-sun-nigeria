Bayern Munich has reportedly made an enquiry to sign Napoli attacker and rumoured Arsenal target, Victor Osimhen, with the Bundesliga giant looking for a replacement for Robert Lewandowski. According to Il Mattino, the German side has approached Napoli over a potential deal to sign Osimhen, with the Serie A club valuing their star attacker at €100m (£85m), a transfer fee Bayern is not willing to pay with Julian Nagelsmann’s side also looking to bring in a central defender. With Bayern signing Sadio Mane from Liverpool and tying Serge Gnabry down to a new long-term contract, the need for a Lewandowksi replacement could realistically wait for another year as the Bundesliga champions potentially look to experiment without a world-class natural striker leading the line. Indeed, Napoli’s £85m price tag for Osimhen would of course put Bayern off signing the Nigerian superstar, with Arsenal also reportedly interested in the 23-year-old attacker, with Mikel Arteta a fan of the forward who has seemingly been on the Gunner’s radar for some time. Although Arsenal has signed Gabriel Jesus this summer, another attacker is not ruled out just yet, with Osimhen a player who could thrive in north London under Arteta, though this new interest from Bayern does throw a spanner in the works for the Gunners. The European titans are one of the biggest clubs in football and Osimhen could realistically join the club in the next 12 months, and for Arsenal, Bayern now look like the most likely side to win the race for the Napoli star’s signature in the future. As one of Serie A’s most unique and best strikers, Osimhen is a player who could develop into a world-class goalscorer if he can remain fit for the upcoming season, and for Bayern, the Nigerian is a perfect replacement for Lewandowski if the Bavarian side can beat the likes of Arsenal to his signature. After all, Osimhen is one of the most in-demand players in Europe, and whilst a move looks unlikely this summer, Bayern could still land the attacker in 2023 if the plan to play without a true Lewandowski replacement fails, much to the dismay of Arsenal.
