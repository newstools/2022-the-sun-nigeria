From Tony Osauzo, Benin Apparently incensed by the recent abduction and killing of a Catholic priest and a hunter, and the growing level of insecurity in the state, the Acting Governor of Edo State, Comrade Philip Shaibu, has given marching order to all traditional rulers to engage local hunters and vigilantes, to flush out criminal Fulani herdsmen in all the forests in the State. The governor gave the order at the end of an emergency security meeting with traditional rulers, opinion leaders and security agencies in Benin City. Part of the resolutions, which was made available to journalists, yesterday, also directed heads of the 18 local government councils in the state to provide stipends and needed resources for the vigilante and hunters, on a monthly basis, to comb the forests and flush out the suspected criminals, and that traditional rulers would, henceforth, be held responsible for any act of kidnapping and terrorism that occurs in their respective domains. That everybody currently residing in any forest in Edo State, in the guise of camping, should vacate such areas with immediate effect. The acting governor has mandated all acting LGC heads to use all the security apparatus, including the police, army, vigilance groups, hunters and others, to forcefully remove any erring groups or individuals within the next 10 days. “That, henceforth, any traditional ruler and village head who had collected money from any herdsmen, therefore, permitting any form of camping or grazing in any Edo State forest should refund such money and ask the herdsmen to leave with immediate effect.”
