From Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha Enugu governorship candidate for Labour Party (LP), Davidson Nnamani, has said the party is on a salvation mission to bring quality leadership to Nigeria and the state. Nnamani said the wind of real change is blowing insistently in Enugu State and across Nigeria where himself, Peter Obi, who is the presidential candidate, and Labour Party were the chosen vessels for the change. He said, in a statement, that Labour Party, under the leadership of Obi and Datti Baba-Ahmed, the vice presidential candidate; himself as governorship candidate and Ocho Obodoeze, the deputy governorship candidate, will bring Nigerians good tidings. Nnamani, who hails from Ikem in Isi-Uzo council, said Obi and Baba-Ahmed have impeccable credentials which, he said, was in public domain while himself and his deputy were homegrown children who knows the people’s pains. He said: Labour Party is the face of new Nigeria. The face of hope. We are all encompassing and we will upgrade Nigeria and Enugu State to a country/state of production not consumption. “For the youths, the elderly, the unemployed and people without structure, we bring you hope. “For women, we appreciate your importance and productivity. And we will go beyond the standard 35 per cent affirmation to inspire you to unleash your innate energy and creativity. “We are politicians in touch with the pains and deprivations of our people at grassroots and throughout the 260 electoral wards in Enugu State,” he said.
