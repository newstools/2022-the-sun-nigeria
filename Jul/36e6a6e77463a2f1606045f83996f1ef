For living her life on social media, Nollywood actress, Anita Joseph, has been a subject of criticism. According to the Anambra State-born thespian married to a younger Michael Olagunju aka MC Fish, celebrity marriage is not a tea party. But then, despite the backlashes she gets on social media, Anita is unfazed, as she has vowed to continue posting her romantic moments online. She told Saturday Sun: “Whenever a colleague’s marriage crashes, the online trolls will come after me. One even told me recently that I could be next victim. However, I pity the people dragging me because they are giving me more reasons to post more romantic moments with my husband on social media. They won’t ever stop me from posting my happy moments. Never!” Reacting to the speculations that she is married to a man over 10 years younger than her, the curvy actress assured that her husband’s age doesn’t matter. “When people try to mock me by saying I married a younger lover, I just laugh. It is very hilarious. You know, people assume a lot. They feel that way because I am plumb and he’s slim; but it’s cool, we don’t care. Is it the age that is their problem? Some of them don’t even have a working relationship. Some can’t keep a man for two months. They can continue talking while we enjoy our marriage. His grace has kept us, so no regrets at all,” Anita quipped.
