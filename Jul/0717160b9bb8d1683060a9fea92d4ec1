By Gabriel Dike, Lagos Six Nigerian students are expected to represent the country in the 2022 Certiport Microsoft Office Specialist World Championship that will take place next week in Disneyland, California, USA. The students and two teachers are being sponsored by Zenith Bank PLC and Agusto Consulting Limited for the competition which will hold from July 21 to 24. They emerged after returning top scores and the fastest times during the national Microsoft Office Specialist World Championship for Students (MOSWC) organised by ReadManna Empowerment Initiative, a not-for-profit organisation that drives learning of current, practical and relevant digital literacy skills in schools and work environment. The students are Hammad Omotosho, of Aduvie International School, Abuja, FCT, who scored 1,000/1,000 in Excel 2019 in 10 minutes 11 seconds; Joshua Olunlade of Adeleke University, Ede, Osun State (Word 2019 – 1,000/1,000 in 10min 46Sec); and Gabari Rume Mamuromu of Faith Academy, Ota, Ogun State (Word 2016 1,000/1,000; 11min 45Sec).

They will be accompanied by two ICT teachers, Mr Olusola Ajayi of Aduvie International School, Abuja, FCT, whose student had the highest score in the 2022 MOS Nigeria competition and Mrs Victoria Adebayo of Faith Academy, Ota, the school with the largest number of certified students in the 2022 ReadManna Under13 Computing Fundamentals National Competition (Ages 8 -13). Noting the importance of Microsoft Office certifications, CEO of Readmanma Empowerment Initiative, Mrs Edna Agusto, said in a statement that proficiency in them gives the students leverage in the labour market. “These Microsoft Office Specialist programmes are the most commonly used productivity tools by businesses worldwide and the official MOS certification programme assesses and demonstrates proficiency in these programmes,” she said. “Certified MOS users will become proficient in the use of Microsoft Office programmes, thereby improving their chances of becoming gainfully employed in today’s digital world. It is globally recognised and gives certified users the opportunity to apply for jobs anywhere in the world.” The MOSWC is keenly competed annually by students in over 150 countries. In the past 13 years, Nigeria has come second and third in the World Championship and has had top 10 finishes nearly every year. The national competition that produced the Nigerian contingent was held between October 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022, with 385 participants taking the examination in Ilorin, Abuja and Lagos. Joshua Olunlade is the second university student to win at the national competition open to students aged 13-22. Nineteen students scored 1,000/1,000 in various programmes.
