From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Abia State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has warned about what it described as the wrong interpretation being given on social media to a court judgment on the PDP 3-man delegate list in Abia State. A state high court sitting in Aba, Abia State had reversed itself in its earlier order which recognized the three-man Adhoc delegates list that produced Prof Uche Ikonne as the PDP governorship candidate on May 25. The order followed a suit filed by one Akuoma Friday on May 16, urging the court to vacate its order. The court presided by Justice C.U. Okoroafor said it erred to have granted such order ab initio, as the new National Judicial Council guideline strips it of the jurisdiction to entertain such matter. In its ruling last week, the court granted the prayer of Akuoma and vacated its earlier order on the recognition of the 3-man delegates list. However, in a statement, Hon Amah Abraham PDP State Vice Chairman/Acting State Publicity Secretary said, “The attention of the Abia PDP has been drawn to a wrong interpretation of a court judgment circulating in the social media that an Abia State High Court has upturned the use of the Abia Ad Hoc three-man delegates for the conduct of Abia State PDP primaries. “Nothing can be further from the truth as the position of the very learned judge simply informed the Claimant that the Court lacks the jurisdiction to entertain the matter before it and therefore referred the entire contents of the matter back to the vexed Claimant who incidentally is not a member of the PDP. “The circulating interpretation is not only the handiwork of Fifth Columnists but also misleading in its entirety and designed to create panic and confusion for the PDP and Abians”. The statement said the state leadership of the PDP admonishes party faithful and all Abians to disregard the misleading interpretation of a judgment, orchestrated by some people who are trying to destroy the PDP.
