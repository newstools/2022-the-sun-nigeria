From Noah Ebije, Kaduna The Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Alhaji Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar, has urged Muslims as well as Nigerian Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia to fast and pray ceaselessly to Allah for His quickest intervention in Nigeria’s myriad of security challenges to ensure peace in the country. The Sultan noted that it was obvious that if Nigerians failed to humble themselves to the Almighty Allah, an end to security challenges seemed not insight. He said, with 2023 general elections fast approaching, there is the need to seek Allah’s intervention for stability, security, peace and development of the country. This was contained in a statement issued on Thursday by the Secretary General, JNI, Dr. Khalid Abubakar Aliyu which was made available to Reporters in Kaduna. “The Sultan calls on the Nigerian Muslims to please in the name of Allah fervently supplicate to Allah for His intervention and an end to the myriad challenges bedeviling the country. It is obvious and very scary if we don’t humble ourselves to the Almighty Allah, an end to these orgies seems not insight if happenings in the country are anything to underscore. “He implores us all to dedicate special prayers against all the menaces and the hydra-headed calamities (of insecurity, poverty, high cost of living and corruption) occurring in Nigeria. “Similarly, with 2023 general elections fast approaching, we need to also seek Allah’s apt intervention for stability, security, peace and development of Nigeria. “Indisputably, as people of faith we must submit ourselves to Allah, especially that all efforts geared towards restoration of peace and order seems to defy solutions. “We however reiterate that the need for fervent prayer for peaceful and smooth political transition, and an end to the varied socio-economic challenges is ardently necessary”. The statement said.
