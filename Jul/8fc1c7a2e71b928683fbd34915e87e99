The reported increase in COVID-19 cases across the country has clearly shown that the disease has not gone away in spite of government efforts. A recent report on the disease revealed that COVID-19 infections in the country had risen to 67 per cent within a period of two weeks. Apart from Nigeria, there has been reported increase of the disease in the United Kingdom (UK) put at 23 per cent some weeks ago, Canada and the United States, among others. According to statistics from the Nigeria Centre for Disease and Control (NCDC), “in weeks 23 and 24, the number of samples tested increased to 75, 277 from 15, 347 reported in weeks 21 and 22. These were reported in the 36 states and the FCT.” Lagos and Rivers states had the highest figures of COVID-19 cases at 314 and 44, respectively in weeks 23 and 24. Also, in weeks 21 and 22, Lagos State came first with 137 cases while Cross River State had one. As at July 12, the increase in COVID-19 cases reportedly rose to 324 per cent within one month. Similarly, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that Nigeria recorded 257, 637 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 3,144 deaths from January 3, 2020 to July 5, 2022. At the same time, the nation’s COVID-19 vaccination rate is considered among the lowest in the world. In the same vein, our testing rate cannot be said to be encouraging considering our population of over 200 million people. The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) recently stated that only about 21 per cent of eligible persons in Nigeria had been fully vaccinated. And not less than seven million eligible persons vaccinated over the past three months. Notwithstanding the mass vaccination campaigns, about 13 states in the country have not vaccinated at least 10 per cent of the eligible population. The problem is no longer the non-availability of COVID-19 vaccines but the reluctance of many Nigerians to take the required jabs. Since COVID-19 shots are impotant, we urge government to do more public enlightenment campaigns about the pandemic, especially in the rural areas. There should also be continuous education on oral and health hygiene necessary to prevent the disease. In addition, the vaccination services should be rigorously pursued in the rural areas. Nigerians must be made to observe the preventive measures against the disease.  The increase in COVID-19 cases is hardly surprising, in view of our general complacency towards observing the COVID-19 preventive measures  such as the use of face masks in public places, social distancing, avoiding crowds, washing of hands with soap and running water and others. Moreover, we have one of the lowest rates of vaccination against the disease in the world. In most worship centres across the country, markets and other public places, these non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 protocols are rather observed in the breach. While some Nigerians erroneously believe that COVID-19 does not exist, the reality of the lethal disease is not in doubt. Since the resurgence of COVID-19 is also traceable to our low rate of vaccination, the government should step up efforts towards ensuring that many Nigerians are given the jabs. Reactivating our disease surveillance systems and testing units at the nation’s entry borders, including land, air and sea, will drastically curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. We call on the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the NCDC to intensify their periodic update and enlightenment about the disease. Religious leaders must ensure that their members comply with the stipulated COVID-19 preventive measures during their weekly gatherings or services. In addition to COVID-19, let government inject more funds towards curbing malaria, tuberculosis, Lassa fever, HIV/AIDS, cholera, chicken pox, yellow fever, monkey pox and many others. As at July 18, 2022, Nigeria had 259,007 confirmed cases; 5,378 active cases, 250,485 discharged cases and 3,144 deaths.
