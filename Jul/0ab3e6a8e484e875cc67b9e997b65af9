Former Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr is of the opinion that Napoli and Nigeria international forward Victor Osimhen can replace Robert Lewandoski at Bayern Munich. Lewandoski is currently pushing for an exit from the Bavarians with his desire solely on joining Barcelona. Both teams are still yet to find an agreement with reports saying three bids from Barcelona have been rejected. In an interview with Bild, Rohr is of the opinion that Osimhen will be the perfect replacement for Lewandoski if he eventually gets his wish to leave the team. Rohr cited the fact that Osimhen spent his formative year in Germany will be an added advantage. Rohr said: “If Bayern let Robert Lewandowski go, Victor would be a good alternative. “I think he will prevail in Munich. Since he already has experience in the Bundesliga and speaks a little German, his adjustment period is, of course, shorter than with other players from abroad.”
