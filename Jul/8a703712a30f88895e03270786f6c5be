Super Falcons safest hands Chiamaka Nnadozie is out of today’s crucial encounter against tough talking  Banyana Banyana of South Africa in the opening Group C match. Her absence at the goalkeeping duties it was gathered, is due to the accumulation of caution cards she received during the competition qualifiers against the Black Queens of Ghana and Ivory Coast.  The Paris FC goalkeeper became the team’s first choice after a decent outing at the 2019 FIFA Women World Cup in France. Israel based Tochukwu Oluehi is expected to take her position in the game slated for Hassan Moulay stadium in Rabat. Oluehi was the heroine in the last edition against the same opponent ( South Africa) as she saved two penalties to hand Nigeria the title for a record 9th time in Ghana. Nnadozie is expected to be back in the team for the two remaining group games against Botswana and Burundi.
