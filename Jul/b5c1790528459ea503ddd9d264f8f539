The Association Of Outsourcing Professionals of Nigeria (AOPN) is seeking a Bill for an Act from the National Assembly to regulate Outsourcing  practise in the country.  Speaking yesterday at the 2022 Outsourcing Expo, the President of AOPN, Obiora Madu, said though the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has reviewed the Outsourcing Policy of 2007, a new legislation would in no small way fix myriads of sharp practices infiltrating the sector.  According to him, any business or profession without a regulation would not work, and automatically it becomes all comers affairs (everybody’s business) which undermines the prosperity of any country.  “Without a piece of legislation, people would behave anyhow and a lot of abnormalities and anomalies would be the order of the day. For instance, there are  people who are doing contracting and think they’re doing  Outsourcing, however Outsourcing is different from contracting,”  AOPN’ president further added that Service Level Agreement  (SLA) in many quarters are not respected anymore for dearth of regulation and sanctions, hence the need for proper regulation. “A principal can wake up one morning and take any drastic or radical decision and dare anybody to do their worst. Employers and many Outsourcing firms are taking advantage of the high rate of unemployment to unleash unprofessional practices on jobs seekers and others.
