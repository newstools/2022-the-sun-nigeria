The 3rd D K Olukoya Women Basketball Championship will welcome teams from outside Nigeria next year. Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Director of Sports, Godwin Enakhena, disclosed this in Lagos. He further explained that the youth empowerment programme is part of the MFM General Overseer, Dr. Daniel Olukoya’s 70 Points Youth repositioning Agenda. Speaking at the end of the 2nd edition of the event in Lagos, Enakhena said Dr. Olukoya would stop at nothing to empower African youths through sports. “The story of MFM and sports are inseparable because Dr. Olukoya’s vision of using sports to engage the youth is unwavering. When we started the Olukoya Women Basketball Championship last year, it had only eight teams participating but that number increased to 12 this year. Eight teams came from outside Lagos, which shows how the championship has grown within a year. “And interestingly, we’ve received messages from women basketball teams in Togo, Ghana and Benin Republic asking to be part of next years edition. I trust Dr. Olukoya to give the go ahead to have these African countries join the party next year,” revealed the pioneer MFM Football Club chairman. Enakhena, who is a sports journalist, explained that MFM would be liaising with the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) towards having a hitch free championship next year because it will be an African event. Dr. Olukoya’s investment in sports has given birth to a football club, MFMFC, a wrestling club, a women’s basketball club that have produced quality athletes who have represented Nigeria.
