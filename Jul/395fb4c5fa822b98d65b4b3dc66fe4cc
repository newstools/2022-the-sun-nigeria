From Fred Itua, Abuja Youths from the 19 northern states, yesterday, endorsed the candidacy of Peter Umeadi, presidential standard-bearer of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). The youths, under the aegis of Congress of Arewa Youth for Peace and Equity, also bestowed an ‘Icon of Hope’  award on Umeadi. President of the group, Garba Yahaya, said the group is supporting the APGA candidate because of his capacity to reconcile Nigerians. “Umeadi has pledged to remove his personal interest entirely if elected president in 2023. He doesn’t have other businesses or interests to protect, while working as president of Nigeria. We trust that Umeadi would reposition Nigeria in four years, employing this triple banner of rule of law, separation of powers and due process, which would bring about security of lives and property,” Yahaya said. Reacting, Umeadi expressed the optimism that APGA would win the 2023 presidential poll. He also listed areas he would focus if elected president. “As president, I want to reconcile the different regions of Nigeria. That reconciliation will be the beginning of the solutions to our problems. I’ll emerge as president through the votes of Nigerians. We must respect the ballots. Elections must be predicated on valid votes. “As president, I’ll ensure the Child Rights Act will be fully implemented. I’ll build a country where nobody will be left behind. About 11 states are yet to domesticate the Child Rights Act. Unfortunately, these 11 states are all in the North. As president, we will hold parents of children roaming the streets responsible. As president, I’ll lead Nigeria through a prosperous path that will be difficult to reverse.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video
