Total carnage it said on the posters, and total carnage is what we got, as Derek Chisora proved there is life in the old dog left by claiming a stunning split-decision victory over an ever-tough Kubrat Pulev on Saturday night at the O2 Arena. A war-hungry Del Boy promised to go for the jugular from the opening bell and stuck to his word as the 38-year-old offered a relentless pace from start to finish, awarded for his efforts with scores of 116-112 and 116-114 in his favour, the other given 116-112 to Pulev. Chisora, who had lost to Oleksandr Usyk and twice to Joseph Parker since last claiming a win – a knockout victory over David Price in 2019 – now throws himself right back into the mix in a heavyweight division littered with enticing match-ups galore. Top of the list for Chisora is a certain Deontay Wilder as the veteran admits his time in the game, following a phenomenal 15-year run, is now finally reaching its end point. Chisora not only regains his status as a top-level heavyweight with what was perhaps a career-best win, but also revenge over his long-term rival, now 41, who himself earned a split-decision victory when the pair first went head-to-head in 2016 in Hamburg, Germany. There had been calls for Chisora to hang up his gloves following his second defeat to Parker in December last year, but, after vehemently insisting that was not an option, stating his love for the game was just too strong, it was perhaps apt that Del Boy made his walk to the O2 Arena ring accompanied by Elvis Presley’s  ‘Always On My Mind’.
