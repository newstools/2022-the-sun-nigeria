The governorship candidate of the Accord Party (AP), in Osun State, Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, said he has visited over 250 communities to campaign across the 30 local governments of the state. He said the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have been paying the crowd for their campaign, describing the public campaign as sheer waste of time. Ogunbiyi who said he has been meeting various associations, unions, and communities, stressed that his style of campaign is a serious vote-seeking method. He told our correspondent in a telephone conversation that the fact that he has not gathered crowds in the public does not mean that he has not been canvassing votes.
