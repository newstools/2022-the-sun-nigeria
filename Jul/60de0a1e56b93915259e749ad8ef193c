From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa.   Assassins again struck in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, Friday, killing a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Odeinyefa Ogbolosingha. Ogbolosingha is the fourth person to be gruesomely murdered in Bayelsa in less than two months fueling fears of violent crime in the state. According to investigations, the masked assassins dressed in military camouflage traced the deceased to his house along Imiringi Road where he was shot in the head at close range and also in the arm and shoulder. The deceased aged 53, an administrative officer in the state civil service and secretary, Okordia/Zarama Cluster Development Board, was killed a few hours after his ailing wife was discharged from the hospital. An eyewitness said two other people who were in the house were shot in the legs when they rushed out on hearing the gunshots that killed Ogbolosingha. Sources fear that the killing of Ogbolosingha could be linked to the lingering crisis in Kalaba community leading to the recent murder of the paramount ruler, and the Community Development Committee (CDC) chairman over their refusal to concede to the setting up of an illegal refinery in the area. Security sources said there was a recommendation before the state government calling for a quick resolution of the crisis consuming the Kalaba community to avert more violent deaths. “Some names were mentioned in the Kalaba crisis, and the state government has been told to intervene to stop these killings. It is enough,” the source said.  The spokesman of the Bayelsa State Police Command, Asinim Butswat, who confirmed the development, stated: “Police operatives responded to a distress call at about 14:00 hours on Friday 22 July 2022, that armed men shot one Odeinyefa Ogbolosingha at his residence at Imiringi road, Yenagoa. “The victim was rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa, for treatment, but was confirmed dead. Investigation has commenced.”
