By Christopher Oji Popular hip-hop artiste, Habib Okikiola (a.k.a Portable) has been quizzed by the police over his action in a viral video where he ordered a group of boys to beat up a boy identified as D.J. Chicken. The Ogun State Police command had requested Portable to report himself at the nearest police station over the viral video or risk arrest. The police said he had honoured the invitation at the command Headquarters, Eleweran Abeokuta, on Wednesday. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said: “The artist reported at Eleweran, at about 5pm, in company with his father and his manager. He was immediately ordered to be taken to the public Complaint Bureau. “The Ogun state Police Command wishes to inform the general public that the hip-hop artist Habib Okikiola (a.k.a Portable), who was requested to report at the nearest police station over a viral video where he was seen ordering a group of boys to beat up one boy, simply identified as D.J Chicken, has reported at the command’s Headquarters, Eleweran, on Wednesday, June 29, 2022. “Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, ordered him to be taken to the Complaint Bureau, where he was interrogated about his role in the assault meted out to the boy in the video. However, since the offence committed is a bailable one, and coupled with the strike action embarked upon by the civil servants in the state, which, also, affected our courts, the suspect was released to a reliable surety, who promised to produce him anytime he is needed.” Meanwhile, the assaulted victim has also been invited to come and state his own side of the story, to enable the command to complete its investigation on time.
