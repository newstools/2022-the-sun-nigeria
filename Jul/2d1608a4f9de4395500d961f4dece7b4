From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to do everything legally and humanly possible to ensure that the defeat to the ruling party in Osun State governorship election did not happen during the 2023 presidential poll. The ruling party blamed the loss to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on the sharp division among its party chieftains and stakeholders in the state. APC Deputy National Organising Secretary, Nze Chidi Duru, who reacted to the defeat, assured that every logistic would be perfected to ensure that the loss was not repeat at the national election. “The Osun State defeat is a lesson learnt for our party. It gives room for introspection. But, more importantly, INEC has proven again to be a credible institution by providing platform for free, fair election. We want to urge them to continue to build on it. It also shows that Nigeria’s vote is beginning to count,” he said. On whether the defeat will affect APC’s outing in 2023 presidential election, Nze Duru said: “Regardless of what happened in Osun, we are confident that it will not happen during the presidentia election. We will certainly submit to the will of the people. It is better that it happened now than happening in 2023. “What happened now will make us go back to the drawing boards to review the lessons learnt, where we did not do right and how we can correct it. We will be much more strategic. Our engagement across board will be intensified. Nothing will be left to chance because everybody is important in the political space. It is important that we all pull together in peace from inside than from outside. We have time to do all of these. “Nobody would like to see the Osun experience in the larger scale of national election. That will be a disaster for the party. If it happens, it will mean that we don’t know how to manage victory at the national level if we exit after eight years. That is the lesson for all of us in the Osun State governorship election,” he said.
