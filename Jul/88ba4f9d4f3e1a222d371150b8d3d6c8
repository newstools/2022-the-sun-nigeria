Newcastle’s search for a striker continues having missed out on a deal to sign Reims striker, Hugo Ekitike earlier this summer. With the Magpies having Callum Wilson and Chris Wood as their only recognised strikers, Eddie Howe is mulling over his options as he seeks more attackers to provide competition for places. And he has been offered Watford’s Emmanuel Dennis and Burnley’ Maxwel Cornet as a result per reports. The Magpies are in serious need of renovation to improve their squad depth given the club has been languishing in the bottom-half of the Premier League for several years. Having not finished in the top half of the league since 2012, Howe’s side is expected to not only improve on a couple of first-team players this summer, but bolster their squad to compete on all fronts. And the Chronicle reports that their strategy has opened the door to potential moves for Cornet and Dennis, who are both available on the cheap having been relegated from the Premier League in the summer. Cornet, who scored nine goals in just 26 appearances for the Clarets last season, has an active £17.5million release clause in his contract due to Burnley’s relegation. The Ivorian was one of the only shining lights in a Burnley side that struggled under eventually sacked manager Sean Dyche and went down on the final day thanks to Newcastle’s 2-1 victory over them at Turf Moor.
