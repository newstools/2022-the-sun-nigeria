From Layi Olanrewaju, Ilorin The police in Kwara have arrested three suspected armed robbers and recovered a pistol and Ak-47 rifle in Ilorin, Kwara State. The suspects are Mohammed Bello, Mohamed Bello and Abubakar Mohammed. In a statement by the spokesman of the Kwara State Police Command, SP Okasanmi Ajayi, in Ilorin said the residents of Oorsha Fulani Camp, Ilorin were awoken by the presence of four armed men about 3 am when they invaded the house of one Mohammed Usman. The suspects launched an attack on Mohammed Usman and his wife, inflicted cuts on their heads and bodies. It was gathered that the suspects got the information from a neighbour that Mohammed Usman sold cows worth N800, 000, early in the day. Okasanmi said the information prompted the armed robbers to carry out the deadly attack on the victims, following which they were dispossessed of the proceeds of the sold cows. The armed robbers disappeared into the bush. “However, the discreet investigation into the matter earnestly commenced as directed by Commissioner of Police, Tuesday Assayomo with a marching order that the criminals be smoked out and made to face justice. “The investigation yielded positive results, as the Command’s tactical teams in conjunction with vigilantes and local hunters started a relentless combing of the bushes, in the cause of which the three suspects were arrested. “During interrogation, the suspects confessed to the crime and took the investigators to their armoury where one Ak-47 rifle, one cut-to-size locally made pistol and one mask was recovered. He said efforts were still in progress toward arresting the leader of the gang who is still at large. “The suspects would be charged to court at the conclusion of the investigation.”
