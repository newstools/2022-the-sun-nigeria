The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has urged Team Nigeria athletes competing at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham to be focused and disciplined, as they carry the aspirations and hopes of over 200 million Nigerians. The first batch of Team Nigeria athletes competing at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham have left the country through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos, while others left through the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. The Sports Minister, the President of the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) Habu Gumel, and the Chef de Mission to the Games, Simon Ebhojiaye were on hand to see off the team that left through Abuja. The Minister charged the athletes to be focused and disciplined with their conduct in Birmingham.  “I want to urge you to be disciplined,” Dare told the athletes. “If you have any complaints, the Ministry has outlined how they can be resolved. There are just three layers for conflict resolution now and by the time you are getting to that third layer, then you are getting to me.”
