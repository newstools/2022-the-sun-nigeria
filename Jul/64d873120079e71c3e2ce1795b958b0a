Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa will be part of the group that will hold a meeting with new Watford goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye on his international future. Okoye hasn’t played for Nigeria since the backlash he suffered from fans for his error that led to the goal Nigeria conceded against Tunisia in the AFCON that sealed the team’s exit from the tournament. The goalkeeper skipped the World Cup qualifiers playoff against Ghana, claiming he has tested positive to coronavirus. He however pulled out of the squad for the game against Sierra Leone and Sao Tome and Principe in the AFCON 2023 qualifiers. He said he is recuperating from a shoulder injury picked up at Sparta Rotterdam but it has since been found out that it isn’t true as he is back in training with Watford. He hasn’t even spoken with the new coach, Jose Peseiro despite attempts to contact him. Peseiro will speak with him before the next international round of games with Musa who is the captain expected to be part of it. Also, the NFF will be represented. The idea is to talk him into putting all that has happened behind and forge ahead.
