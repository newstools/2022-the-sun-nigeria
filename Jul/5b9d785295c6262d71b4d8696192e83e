From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja  The National Peace Committee (NPC) has expressed delight over the outcome of Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State.  Its chairman and former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, in a statement in Abuja commended and congratulated the people of Osun State over their peaceful conduct during the election.  He called on the winner of the election, Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to be benevolent in victory, urging him and his political party “to eschew triumphalism that may make peace-building difficult after what at certain moments was a fractiously fought election.” Abubakar commended the people of Osun State for coming out in large numbers, abiding to the procedures set out by the Electoral Act and implemented by the electoral commission. “We strongly decry the incidences of vote-trading recorded during the elections. This criminal offence should not be treated with levity because it threatens the credibility of the process. It reduces the privileged selection of those who steward our commonwealth through our electoral processes, as being transactional. We must hold to account all who would muddy the springs from which we as a people seek to drink from collectively by such actions of bribery, both the giver and receiver,” Abubakar said.
