The former Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, 67, was assassinated on Friday in the city of Nara during a political rally. Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving Japanese prime minister, made it his political mission to vanquish his country’s wartime ghosts but fell short of his goal of restoring Japan as a normalized military power. Mr. Abe, the scion of a staunchly nationalist family of leading politicians, had the longest uninterrupted tenure as prime minister in Japanese history, nearly eight years beginning in 2012. He had previously served a year in an earlier stint as the country’s leader.
