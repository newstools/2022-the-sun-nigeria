The Musical Copyright Society Nigeria (MCSN) has elected new Board members to pilot the affairs of the Society for the next three years. At the election held at its Annual General Meeting in Lagos on Wednesday June 29, 2022, Orits Williki, Tee Mac Iseli, Kenny Ogungbe, Segun Alile, Mojisola Fayemi, Mike Pam Mbala, and Pastor Kola Olulana were nominated and unanimously elected as board members (directors) of the Society. The nominations of Sunny Neji, Asha Fapohunda, Mathew Ohio and Victor Okhai  were also ratified as directors to represent groups/associations and special interests. However, received and unanimously approved by the General Assembly at the meeting were the chairman’s report of events and developments as at December 31, 2021, directors’ report for the year ended December 31, 2021 and financial report for the year ended December 31, 2021, which showed a great leap in surplus when compared with the previous year. In his address, MCSN’s president, King Sunny Ade thanked the Board of Directors led by Orits Williki for the great job done. He declared: “The management under the leadership of our Director General/Chief Executive, Mr. Mayo Ayilaran, deserves our collective appreciation for their undiluted focus, determination and resolve to ensure that our Society continues to deliver the dividends of copyright to us all. Distribution of royalties have resumed and this has been increasing in volume and all areas of our expectation are being attended to.” Orits Williki, who admitted that the Society fell short of the projections for the year 2021 in terms of regular collections, said the successes recorded on the legal front more than compensated for the short fall. An important milestone recorded was the resolution of the Society’s struggle against Multichoice Nigeria at the end of which the latter paid N2.75 Billion to MCSN. He, however, thanked the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) particularly the Director General, John Asein for his support.
