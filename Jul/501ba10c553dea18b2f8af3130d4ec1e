By Vincent Kalu The National President of Indigenous Igbo Youth Congress (IIYC), Chief John Mayor Echefu, has said that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Obi is a pan-Nigeria candidate. Speaking with Saturday Sun, Chief Echefu noted that alluding to Obi as a candidate of the Igbo was tantamount to demarketing him, and making him look as an ethnic champion “It is very unfortunate that some mischief makers are saying Peter Obi is an Igbo candidate. The man has come as a pan-Nigeria candidate to rewrite the ugly story of this country. The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a Yoruba from South-West, how many people are addressing him as a Yoruba candidate? Also, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar is a Fulani from North-East. How many are referring to him as a Fulani candidate? “Peter Obi is coming not as a Christian candidate or a Muslim candidate; he is coming as a candidate of all Nigerians to bring back the lost glory of this country. As Anambra State governor, his security details were mostly people from other ethnic groups and religion. “Who is not affected by the hardship in this country occasioned by inept and corrupt leadership that we have had for the over 20 years now? “Those afraid of his rising profile and the revolution sweeping across the country are the ones trying to de-market him, but they have all failed because Nigerians, especially the youths know the truth and they know what they wanted from the next leadership of the country and Obi is richly endowed, and fit into their template of 21st Century leadership,” Echefu said.
