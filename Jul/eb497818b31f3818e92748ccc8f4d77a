Kenya based sports empowering outfit, Green Sports Africa has disclosed plans to foster the growth of grassroots football in Nigeria. The body in partnership with Master-Card revealed this in Lagos during an interactive session with several grassroots football coaches across the state. In the event tagged “Take the shot,” according to the conveners, George Ouma and Kazeem Ismaily are poised to tutor coaches and reveal lasting solutions to the downfall of football at the grassroots level. The duo hinted that their vision is to see lads attain greater heights with their initiative which has spread across Africa. “Around the world, almost every young child dreams of becoming a world-renowned football superstar. We, at Green Sports Africa are no different. We had dreams of playing for the likes of Arsenal and Barcelona on the world stage in front of thousands of adoring fans but unfortunately growing up in Kenya, there was no clear structure to enable us to reach those dreams.
