By Paul Erewuba Napoli of Italy striker, Victor Osimhen, yesterday, revealed worries surrounding his football career, even as he begs Almighty God to guide him on the right path. Indeed, Osimhen’s future hangs in the balance with the transfer window still yet to close. While Napoli has made a number of signings, there haven’t been enough ready-made signings for the team. The Super Eagles forward has been involved in several transfer speculations this off season with concerted interests reportedly from the Premier League. The forward scored on Thursday for the Neapolitans in their 10-0 pre-season win. With the exit of Kalidou Koulibaly and a host of other top Napoli stars, Osimhen is believed to be fervently thinking of his future and the next steps to take. The forward yesterday tweeted; “I Put My Faith In GOD knowing Fully Well That He Alone Will Continue To See Me Through Life’s Journey.” Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Newcastle have all been reported as potential destinations for the former Lille man but nothing concrete has been met.
