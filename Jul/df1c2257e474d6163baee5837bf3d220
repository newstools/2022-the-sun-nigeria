Nigeria female football great Perpetua Nkwocha has applauded Asisat Oshoala after the Barcelona striker was named the winner of the CAF Women Player of the Year award for a record fifth time. Nkwocha was the first player in history to pick up the award four times, claiming the top honours in 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2011. Undoubtedly still the most spectacular player to ever feature at the Women Africa Cup of Nations, Nkwocha won the tournament an astonishing five times. She was also the competition’s highest goalscorer, a record four times. And no one has come close to equalling or surpassing the 11 goals – the WAFCON record – Nkwocha netted at the 2010 edition. The 46-year-old is, however, pleased to see Asisat Oshoala take off one of her crowns. Nkwocha also backs her younger compatriot to achieve more in the sport before hanging the boots. “I am very happy for Asisat,” Nkwocha told CAF Online. “She deserves this and more. She is still young. She should keep up the hard work, and she will continue dominating.
