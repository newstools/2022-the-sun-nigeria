Allnigeriasoccer.com has been told that Premier League side Southampton are on the verge of announcing the signing of Super Eagles star Joe Aribo. The Glasgow Rangers midfielder has ended speculation about his future by agreeing a four-year deal with Southampton. It is understood that the Saints will officially announce the capture of Aribo within the next twenty four hours as all the necessary paperwork has been completed. Scottish Cup winners Rangers have agreed to shred their contract with the Nigeria international one year before its expiration after accepting a ten million pounds (approximately N4.98 billion in Nigerian currency) bid from Southampton. The Light Blues have made a killing from the sale of Aribo considering that the midfielder was acquired from Charlton Athletic for 300,000 pounds three years ago. Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace and Fulham were linked with possible moves for the 25-year-old but incoming Southampton head of first team recruitment Joe Shields played a key role in the St Mary’s outfit winning the race for his services. Shields has very close links with Aribo and convinced him to support his project at Southampton.
