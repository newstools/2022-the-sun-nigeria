Various communities in Amakama, Umuahia South Local Government Area of Abia State have staged a peaceful protest against Federal Emergency Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA’s) refusal to provide social amenities to the communities as agreed when they gave out their lands to the Ministry of Works. The protest which started from the Amakama point of the Ururuka road, took placards-bearing protesters to Federal Ministry of Works state headquarters, en route to Isicourt, where FERMA’s workshop is situated. They chanted protests songs, demanding rehabilitation of their roads and other rights that were accrual to the communities which the Ministry had refused to provide or maintain since they gave them their lands. At both FERMA’s workshop and headquarters of the Ministry, they read out their demands, chronicled in a two-page document which they handed over to all the officers in charge. The communities complained that many Amakama citizens had fallen prey to the horrible and terrible activities of evil men, who operated on the failed portion of the road, because of its deplorable nature.    The situation, they said, could have been be averted if the Ministry through FERMA had provided drainage on the two sides of the road. The communities were represented by Hon. Prince Daniel Ejim, the councilor representing Amakama ward in Umuahia South legislative chambers, Comrade Ugochukwu Emeruwa, the President-General of Alaoji Amakama Autonomous community, and Engr. Obioma Irozuru, the President-General of Amakama Autonomous community.
