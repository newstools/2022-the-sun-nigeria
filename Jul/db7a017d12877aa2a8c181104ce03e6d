By Chinwendu Obienyi Union Bank has announced the return of the Save & Win Promo, its flagship campaign aimed at rewarding new and existing customers with cash rewards and other gift items worth over N55 million. Following a successful first season, this second edition of the nationwide campaign which coincides with the Bank’s 105th anniversary will benefit more customers to appreciate them for their support and loyalty over the years. Speaking on the reason for the campaign’s rerun, Lola Cardoso, Union Bank’s Head, Retail Banking & Digital said, the bank is excited with the second campaign as it is an opportunity to give back to its customers in a way that matters while promoting the savings culture among Nigerians. Cardoso said, “As we celebrate our 105th anniversary, we remain committed to delivering products and services that enable our customers to achieve their personal and business goals.” The promo which will run from June to December 2022, is open to new and existing customers who save a minimum amount of N10,000 monthly. Savers who qualify to participate in the monthly, quarterly and end of the year draws stand a chance to win N105,000 monthly while 5 winners will go home with N500,000 each in two of the quarterly draws. One lucky customer will snag the star price of N5 million during the grand finale set to hold in December alongside other consolation prices. To increase their chances of winning in the draws, customers can continue to top up their savings in multiples of N10,000. Winners in the promo will emerge through a series of transparent, electronically- generated draws which will be supervised by relevant regulatory institutions. Prospective customers can download the UnionMobile app on their mobile phones to open accounts, or walk into any Union Bank branch.
