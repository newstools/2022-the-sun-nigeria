This is contained in a statement issued on Sunday in Abuja by his Special Assistant on New Media, Malam Bashar Abubakar. “In the build-up to the forthcoming general polls, we as politicians and other stakeholders in the nation’s nascent democracy must play by the rules and ensure rancour-free activities. “Doing otherwise will not do us or the country any good,’’ the former Sokoto State governor warned.

He thanked APC supporters in the state for their “resilience, doggedness and prayers toward the success of the party at all levels especially as the general elections approach’’. Wamakko urged supporters to ensure that they got their Permanent Voter Card as it is the only tool needed to elect credible leaders.
