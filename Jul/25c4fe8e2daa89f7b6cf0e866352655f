From Paul Osuyi, Asaba There is disquiet in the camp within the People Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State as news filtered in on Thursday evening that an Abuja High Court has disqualified it’s 2023 governorship candidate, Sheriff Francis Oborevwori over discrepancies in his academic certificates. Oborevwori who is the current Speaker of the state House of Assembly, won the May 25, 2022 governorship primaries held in Asaba. But his main challenger, David Edevbie who came a distant second approached the court, seeking the disqualification. There were other cases that have be disposed off by the court for lack of locus on the part of the plaintiffs but the Edevbie’s suit has disqualified the Speaker from the 2023 governorship contest. The court presided over by Justice Taiwo Taiwo in the ruling also restrained Oborevwori from parading himself as the governorship candidate of the PDP in Delta State for the 2023 election. As at the time of filing this report, the camp of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and the state leadership of the PDP maintained studied silence over the ruling. However, an inside source who pleaded not to be named in print, said the ruling would be obtained and studied for the purpose of appealing it. The source said there was no cause for alarm, noting that the party would explore all legal options to upturn the ruling.
