From Lateef Dada, Osogbo,  Ngozi Uwujare and Okwe Obi, Abuja The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, yesterday admonished Osun State voters to defend their votes and ensure that the result is announced before they leave the polling unit. Speaking at the PDP grand finale rally ahead of Saturday’s governorship election in Osun, the former vice president urged the electorate not to allow APC to rig Saturday’s poll so that people of the state would not go back to darkness which they have created. He enjoined people of the state to come out enmasse to support the governorship candidate of the PDP,  Senator Ademola Adeleke to win the election. Also in his speech, the National Chairman of PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, at the rally held at its campaign office, opposite Biket hospital junction, along Ikirun road, Osogbo said the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) has provoked hunger, poverty and darkness in the state. “Let us work for Senator Ademola Adeleke for Saturday election to make a change because PDP will rescue Osun people and Nigerians from darkness,” Ayu stated. The Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri,  who also graced the event urged the electorate to vote out APC and allow PDP to rule for the development of the state. Senator Diri said the Osun election is not for the people of the state alone but for Nigerians in general. The governorship candidate of the PDP, Senator Ademola Adeleke promised to bring development to the state if elected. He said a vote for him is a vote for progress, development and regular payment of pension. The Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto, and former Governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola, attended the rally.
