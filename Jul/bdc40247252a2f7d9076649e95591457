For many years, Hon. Adebukola Olawale Olopade’s exploits in the public sector via political appointments and then the transition to the private sector have ensured that his trajectory has been in the public eye. Before venturing into sports marketing via his Nilayo Sports Management Limited, Olopade was the Ogun State Commissioner for Youths and Sports under the Gbenga Daniel administration. Today, this gentleman has become a notable name in the nation’s sport circle as the brain behind top rated Access Bank Lagos International Marathon, Abeokuta 10km race and the Remo ultra-race. Olopade is also the Chairman of Stormers Sports Club —an Abeokuta-based football Club currently in the Nigeria National League. This rich resume has earned Olopade wide applause and recognition. And he hasn’t stopped getting newer fitting feathers to his illustrious cap as witnessed on Friday, June 24, when the rocky city of Abeokuta, the capital city of Ogun State became agog. On that date, Olopade was installed as the Osi Asoju Oba of Egbaland by the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo (CFR) Okunkenu IV at the Ake Palace in Abeokuta. The prestigious Egba title was in recognition of Olopade’s invaluable services to Egbaland and Nigeria in general particularly in the areas of sports and youth development. Olopade’s lovely wife, Yetunde, was also honoured as the Erelu Osi Asoju Oba of Egbaland by the monarch. Olopade, popularly known as “Ozogula” by his friends and associates, is well noted for throwing top notch parties. He gave a dose of that as his guests —including top members of Nigeria social establishments— were treated to a five-star experience at the reception held at the Marquee of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta where Tolu Obey, son of music legend, Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey, was on the bandstand.
