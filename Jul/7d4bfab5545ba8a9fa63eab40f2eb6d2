From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja Presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has appealed  to his supporters to tolerate other people’s views and opinions and possibly learns from them even if  they are different. The LP flag bearer who is widely favoured among the Nigerian youths, wrote the appeal on his Instagram page at the weekend. He asked his supporters to rather channel their energy towards convincing others and gaining more support regardless of their anger and frustrations. “I sincerely thank my supporters for believing in me and my commitment to building a united, secure and well-functioning Nigeria. However, I appeal once more that we should be tolerant of other people’s views, dissent and divergent opinions & possibly learn from them. “While the frustration and anger in the country is understandable, we must strive to channel that energy positively in ways that will earn the support and collaboration of others. “Even as our message continues to gain broad acceptance, there are some we still need to work to convince. In expressing ourselves, we should do so with grace so as not to precipitately shut doors to future collaborations on sustainable nationbuilding.”
