From David Onwuchekwa, Awka A pressure group, Equity Movement Turn By Turn, has thrown its weight behind the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and his running mate, Datti Baba-Ahmed. The group said the decision to settle for Obi and Baba-Ahmed was taken after its national meeting in Abuja. In a statement, yesterday, by its National Chairman, Gaius Ezeh; directors of Western Region, Oluwatuase Kolawole; Eastern Region, Dan Ejianya, and Northern Region, Ahmed Tukur, the group said Obi and Baba-Ahmed deserve massive support by Nigerians to win in the poll and fix the rot in the country. The group said it had done a careful study on the two candidates and believed Obi and Baba-Ahmed were very prepared to work for a new Nigeria. “A look at their personalities and achievements in the business world and their leadership qualities in Anambra State and Baze University, respectively, you need not have a second thought to be convinced that the duo are capable of rescuing a failing (if not failed) country like Nigeria. We must thank God for raising these two gentlemen of reputable records. “Equity Movement Turn by Turn believes Nigerians are  safer in the hands of the duo. Having studied their antecedents and pedigree, we believe the two personalities deserve the unflinching support of every Nigerian. Our children and youths should  emulate their worthy characters towards achieving a new and better Nigeria to make the country a super power and the giant of Africa it is called. “Our movement stands for justice and fairness among the six geo-political zones, and for the LP to give that mandate to a credible man from South East like Peter Obi, is a welcome development and equity in practice,” the group said.
