Football legend, Austin Jay Jay Okocha has joined forces with Bundesliga to discover a budding talent capable of stepping into his shoes. Okocha said this on Saturday at the opening ceremony of a new 5-aside football pitch in Lagos built by Bundesliga, the topmost German Football league that airs exclusively on StarTimes. Jay Jay Okocha became an instant household name in Germany when he scored one of the most iconic goals in football after a sensational dribble of Oliver Kahn and five defenders before he found the back of the net. In a media chat at the pitch, Okocha stated that he met with the goalkeeper after that game, and emphasised that they remain as friends. “Well, I’ve seen him after that. We are not enemies; we are all just doing our jobs and I’m delighted I scored that goal. It was a goal that introduced me to Europe and it’s still a special goal.” The new pitch built at LSDPC Estate, Meran Lagos is part of Bundesliga’s programme for global pitch refurbishment activation in support of football, with the novel event tagged “Common Ground”. The Bundesliga legend noted the facility will “keep the youth away from trouble.” He promised to visit the pitch “from time to time.
