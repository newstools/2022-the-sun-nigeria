From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi   Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has told the US government and the international community to hold President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration accountable for the continued spate of violence in Nigeria. Ortom who made the call at the State Department, Washington DC, while interacting with its officials, also said President Buhari and his government should be held responsible if anything happens to him. The governor while citing series of threats he had been receiving, and the attempt made on his life in March last year, said there were signals that the Presidency and its conspirators were after him. He said till date, those who attacked him had not been prosecuted. He said he was at the State Department to present the traumatised Nigerian victims’ side of the story after discovering that wrong narratives were being circulated across the globe by the government of Buhari to shield itself from complicity. “The false narrative of herder-farmer clashes was deliberately crafted to delay farmers’ doomsday until they were gradually wiped out, and their ancestral lands confiscated. “The truth is that the farming population in Nigeria is under siege and being decimated; agriculture is gradually dying and food security is being threatened,” the governor stated.
