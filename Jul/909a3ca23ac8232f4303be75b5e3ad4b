From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Bayelsa State Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS), Government House, Alex Tesufa Dumbo, yesterday, dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Social Democratic Party (SDP). His resignation came days after the Brass Local Government Area Chairman, Victor Inodunimi Isaiah, dumped the party. In a letter to the Ekeremor Ward 3 chairman, Dumbo said his resignation is premised “on the consistent display of negative bias against some of us rudely branded as restoration politicians by the topmost hierarchy of PDP in Bayelsa State He said his strong principles of equity, justice and equal opportunities have been trampled upon in PDP and has decided to pitch his tent with SDP. Dumbo apologised to former governor, Seriake Dickson, and deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, for the embarrassment his defection might cause them. Meanwhile, Isaiah disclosed he has uncovered a plot to impeach him because of dumping the PDP, warning that as the council chairman, he would not condone any security threat in the local government. The Brass council chairman, in a statement, entitled: “I should not be blamed for leaving PDP,” said there is desperation to unseat him before the expiration of his tenure because his defection to SDP was not received well in Bayelsa government house. Isaiah, who noted that the defection of Dumbo “is the beginning of mass defection from Bayelsa PDP,” added that “many more will still leave their party so they can continue with the segregation and high-handedness.” PDP Publicity Secretary, Ebiye Ogoli, in a telephone interview, said the party is not perturbed and would not join issues with the defectors.
