Commercial tricycle riders, on Wednesday, apprehended two suspected kidnappers and handed them over to police operatives in Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta.   The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the incident happened at about 8:00 a.m. within the neighborhood of Urhobo College on Effurun/Sapele road.   The tricyclists explained that the suspects, who operated with a tricycle, tried to force a woman out of her car into their waiting tricycle beside a first generation bank.   They said that the victim raised an alarm which made the third suspect, who pointed gun at her to flee the scene of the incident with their operational tricycle, while the other two were chased and apprehended.   A senior police officer attached to Ugborikoko Police Division in Effurun, who preferred anonymity, however, said that the same suspects were arrested six months ago for attempting to snatch a commercial tricycle in Warri but later escaped.   He said that the suspects had been transferred to the police headquarters in Asaba for further interrogation.   When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the police command in the state, Bright Edafe said he had heard about the incident but that he had not seen the report.
