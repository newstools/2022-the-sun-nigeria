From Stanley Uzoaru,Owerri The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has declared a sit-at-home today, in solidarity with its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who appears in court the same day on his trial on human rights violation. Media and Publicity Secretary of the group, Emma Powerful, however, urged people of the South East to remain indoors, while those residing in Abuja he enjoined to move to the venue with Kanu. IPOB has exempted hospitals and its staff as well as journalists from the order. “Our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, goes to court tomorrow, November 10, and our people should stay indoors, while others move to Abuja in solidarity with our leader, and we are expecting the Nigerian government and DSS to release him unconditionally, because he committed no crime to seek his people’s freedom from Nigeria. “We hope people will comply with this order and obey our resolve to support our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. IPOB must allow our people like doctors, hospitals, nurses, ambulance and journalists to operate during the sit-at-home because we don’t want pregnant women, sick people to have issues or complications because of their health. “Doctors must come to the hospitals, but you must identify yourself as journalists to be allowed to report what is going on in the whole of Biafraland,” Powerful stated.
