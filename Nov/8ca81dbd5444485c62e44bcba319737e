A former Chelsea striker, Didier Drogba, will retire from the sport at the end of United Soccer League (USL) season in November 2018. The Ivorian won four Premier League titles among 14 trophies in a Chelsea career spanning more than 380 appearances. The 39-year-old is currently playing for Phoenix Rising in the second tier of United States professional soccer. “Ah, do you want a scoop? I think next year will be my last season,” Drogba told French news outlet RMC Sport. “At some point, you have to stop. I need to have time for my other projects. It’s good to play, but at 39, it holds me back a bit.” Drogba has enjoyed an illustrious club career, playing more than 670 games for eight different teams, including French side Olympique Marseille and Turkey’s Galatasaray.(NAN)
