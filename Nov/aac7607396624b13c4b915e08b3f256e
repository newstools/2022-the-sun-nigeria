Police investigators recovered semen-stained pants belonging to the suspect and his late mother from the room as exhibits. Tony Osauzo, Benin  A 21-year-old boy has reportedly killed his mother and had multiple sex with her corpse in a bid to get rich quickly. The bizarre incident occurred in their rented apartment at 8B Market road, Ologbo in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of Edo State on Monday, October 29, this year. The suspect, Samuel Emobor Oghenekporboro, allegedly strangled her 58-year-old mother, Mrs Christiana Ighoyivwi, and had sex with her lifeless body with the expectation that money would gush out in the process. The victim’s mother, Mrs Maria Gabriel, reportedly discovered the ugly incident when she went to her daughter’s residence about 6 a.m. to invite her to a nearby church for morning prayer. The old woman was said to have knocked repeatedly on her daughter’s door without getting any response. This prompted her to peep through an opening in the window when she saw the lifeless body of her daughter and raised the alarm. Consequently, the killer son, Samuel, was said to have swiftly opened the door and attempted to escape but was held by neighbours who handed him over to the police at Ologbo. Police investigators recovered semen-stained pants belonging to the suspect and his late mother from the room as exhibits. Confirming the incident, spokesman for the Edo State Police Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said investigation was ongoing, adding that the suspect would be arraigned soon.
