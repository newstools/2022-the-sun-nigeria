Paul Osuyi, Asaba The Buhari Support Organizations (BSO) on Saturday in Asaba promised to secure 51 percent votes in Delta State for incumbent president and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Muhammadu Buhari in the 2019 presidential election. Buhari scored about 42,000 votes as against the over two million votes of the then incumbent president, Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State during the 2015 presidential election. But the BSO argued that the 2015 figures were not true reflection of the wishes of the electorate in the state, noting that the group is now more committed to change the narrative and ensure that the incumbent secures the highest number of votes from the oil rich state.

They stole a lot of votes belonging to the president. These are the kind of things we will not tolerate anymore. We will not allow the government of the state and INEC to subvert the will of the people. They cannot steal votes belonging to Buhari. “However, we want to ensure that the president comes first in the state, in other words, we want to have at least 51 percent of the votes. And that will win the state fair and square. The people must be made and encouraged to resist. The important thing is to protect the votes and proper accounting given for the votes,” he said.
