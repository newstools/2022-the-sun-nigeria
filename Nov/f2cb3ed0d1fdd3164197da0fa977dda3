Bournemouth goalkeeper, Joseph Oluwabusola, left the Estadio Bezerrão Stadium in Brasilia with his reputation intact despite the Golden Eaglets suffering a 2-1 loss at the hands of Australia in their final group game of the 2019 FIFA U17 World Cup on Friday evening, as he was one of the few Nigeria players that impressed.  The 2003-born glovesman, who had appeared in friendly matches for the Golden Eaglets prior to the game against the Joeys, became provisionally cap-tied to Nigeria after he was named in the starting line-up, but remains eligible to represent his country of birth, England until he plays a full competitive international for the three-time African champions. Speaking post-match, Oluwabusola was disappointed with the result and noted that the players have to work on their finishing having played 34 shots in total with only one ending up in the back of the net in the game against Australia. ‘’Obviously we are a bit disappointed that we lost, it is unfortunate. I think that it is tough luck, we were a bit unlucky at times,’’ Oluwabusola told reporters including allnigeriasoccer.com. ‘’We put in our best, I know that in the next few days we are going to really train hard. Football is a game about goals and I know that with the help of our coaches we will be able to train on finishing. ‘’It is unfortunate that again we conceded goals, one was a penalty but I know that by God’s grace in the round of 16 we’ll win and we will keep on winning, we will put in a lot of effort to make Nigeria proud.’’
