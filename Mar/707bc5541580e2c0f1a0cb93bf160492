Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, the Registrar of Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), has commended the Nigerian media for their role in nation building and transformation of the society. He gave the commendation in a statement by its Director of Media and Publicity, Dr Fabian Benjamin, yesterday in Lagos. He said the media remained a veritable tool in the board’s quest to execute its mandate of ensuring a brighter future for the Nigerian child. “The JAMB will like to commend the role of the Nigeria media, especially in its quest to sensitise the public on the innovations carried out in the sale of 2017 application document. “Of great interest is particularly on the recent publicity given by some media outfits over the `no admission for awaiting candidates,” Oloyede said. JAMB, however, faulted some of the headlines in the publications, noting that curious readers would jump into conclusion by merely reading the headlines of the publications without reading the body of the stories. “Such headlines led to readers to think that JAMB had excluded candidates with awaiting results from taking the unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, which is not true. “Such attitude is not only capable of misleading the public but could cause disaffection, anger, misconception of Federal Government guidelines on admissions,” he said.
