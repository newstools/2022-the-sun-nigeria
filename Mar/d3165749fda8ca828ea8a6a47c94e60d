From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has described the late Publisher of Hallmark Newspapers, Prince Emeka Obasi, as a man who lived a patriotic life, contributing to the growth of the nation and welfare of citizens, setting up legacies like the Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), which organises the annual Zik Prize in Leadership Awards.
