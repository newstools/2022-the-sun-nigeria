From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonyei, Abuja Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has said the process of deleting section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 is still on.  “My clear response arising there from is the fact that truly there exist a court judgment. By the judgment, the court directed the Office of the Attorney General, to take the necessary steps to delete the provision, which in essence implies that the provision should not form part of our laws.  “Whether it has been deleted, or has not been deleted, is indeed a function of agencies of government and associated, relevant parastatals. But the true position of it in that respect, is the fact that government printers, and indeed Law Reform Commission among others, that are responsible for the codification and gazetting of our laws, are working naturally, hand in hand with the Office of the Attorney General for the purpose of ensuring that what goes into our laws are indeed in  line with the provision of the law.  “So what I am saying in essence, it is indeed a work in progress against the background of the fact that the Law Reform Commission is involved statutorily, which is a parastatal under the Office of the Attorney General, is a party to the process of condification.  “The government printers, which is saddled with the responsibility of gazetting our laws on the request of the Office of the Attorney General is equally involved. And above all, as you rightly stated, the possibility of an appeal is equally there. So, what I am saying in  effect is deletion of section 84 Subsection 12 is a work in progress and is being considered as such.”
