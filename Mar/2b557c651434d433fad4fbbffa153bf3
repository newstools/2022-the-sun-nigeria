From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has said the 2023 general election would be a referendum where  Nigerians would decide the kind of country they want. He stated this, in Abuja, yesterday, when he formally declared to contest the 2023 presidential poll on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He alleged that ahead of the poll, the All Progressives Congress (APC) plans to divide Nigerians along political, ethnic and religious lines.  “The 2023 election is not just like the usual elections; it is a referendum to decide whether we want greatness or continuous destruction. It is a choice between two paths: the path of unity and progress or the path of division and backwardness.  “We need a new kind of leadership that will steer us to a positive path. In 2023, we want a president who has ideas on how to fix Nigeria. We want a president who understands, who inspires and is empathetic.  “As the election is fast approaching, we should not be distracted from the devastating conditions we are in now. The ruling party wants to divide us; they want to divide us along the political, ethnic, and religious lines so that we forget to blame them for the rising inflation.  “They want to distract us from holding them responsible for the insecurity and rising poverty. They want us to be facing each other and hating one another. We should focus on the issues, not our differences. Let us unite and fight our common enemies: the lack of unity, insecurity, poverty, inflation, and unemployment.  “That is what this election is about. I have no doubt in my mind that we as Nigerians can do it. We have done it in 1993. We can do it in 2023. We must stand firm, get our PVCs, come out en-masse, cast our votes, and protect it against any manipulation.”
