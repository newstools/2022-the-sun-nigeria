The people of Nguru Nweafor Autonomous community in Aboh Mbaise Local Government of Imo State  have unanimously elected Dr. Ibeawuchi (Frank) Amagwu as their new traditional ruler. He emerged through a plebiscite conducted by the officials of the Imo State government through the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. At the event, the people spoke with one voice to confirm Amagwu as their preferred choice for the stool based on his tested abilities and leadership traits as experienced by them in the community. The stool has been vacant  since February 2016 when the former Eze, Dr. Oswald Okechukwu Anyanwu, the Otu Obi 1 was kidnapped by yet-to-be identified persons and has not been released ever since, hence the clamour for a new Eze by the people. Amagwu was until now the traditional prime-minister (Ishi Nze) and has been acting as the head of Eze’s cabinet since 2016. Before his election, he was a former Director in the operations department at the Central Bank of Nigeria and retired in November 2021.  An associate professor, the new Eze-elect is now to be known as Otu Obi 2.
