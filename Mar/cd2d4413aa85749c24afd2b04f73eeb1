With the theme: “The Role of Digitalisation in Transforming the Economy,” these professionals would lay bare why everyone, including corporate bodies, should conscientiously adopt digitization fully as an essential enabler of business operations. Commenting on the coming program the CEO of Edniesal Consulting doubling as the convener of CIO Awards/ CIO Club Africa, Abiola Laseinde, affirmed that the summit will advance the cause of digital transformation and pull stakeholders across sectors to brainstorm, network and collaborate for a better economy of Nigeria. “Consumers, businesses and governments have all adopted linked digital services in recent years and this has become a crucial economic engine that has accelerated development and facilitated job creation.
