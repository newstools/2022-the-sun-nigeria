Bianca Iboma A cleric in one of the Lagos-based Pentecostal churches, Pastor Peter Oboh, has called on the former vice president and presidential candidate of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Abubakar Atiku, to accept the result of the presidential and National Assembly polls held last weekend.  President Muhammadu Buhari polled 15 million votes, while Alhaji Atiku got 11 million votes, thereby making Buhari to emerge winner by four million votes. Oboh, who spoke in Lagos, yesterday called on Atiku to join other Nigerians to support the president, in order to move the nation forward. “Rather than go to court, I will implore the former vice president to congratulate the president in the spirit of sportsmanship. President Buhari’s victory shocked many Nigerians, but not a surprise to me.  “Nigeria is a country that is full of surprises, that is why the country is so unique. The margin by northern votes in Buhari’s favour was so great that I began to wonder if Atiku is not a northerner, too. “Buhari is the second man in Nigerian history to be democratically elected for eight years.”  But,  I would say the two gentlemen are winners, and that is the reason all hands must be on deck to ensure Buhari succeeds in this second term,” Oboh said.
