It has produced outstanding alumni, such as the mathematician Vitold Belevich and Queen Mathilde of Belgium. The Rector of the University, Vincent Blondel, stated that the Academic Council considered Chimamanda’s work to be “remarkable in many ways and particularly inspiring for the university community.” Adichie, a celebrated feminist, has written the novels Purple Hibiscus (2003), Half of a Yellow Sun (2006), and Americanah (2013), the short story collection The Thing Around Your Neck (2009), and the book-length essay We Should All Be Feminists (2014). Her most recent books include Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions (2017), Zikora (2020) and Notes on Grief (2021). In 2008, she was awarded a MacArthur Genius Grant.
