Thank God that Courts are there to shoot down such controversial laws. “Some members of the National Assembly behind the annoying section of the law strategically planned to have a competitive advantage over others as 2023 elections draws nearer. “With this, they should use the strength of their offices coupled with their achievements over the years to contest without infringing on the right of others to occupy offices in the country”, Isah said.
