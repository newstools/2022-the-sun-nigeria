From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Emefiele Support Group (ESG), yesterday, said it had raised N67 million to buy the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential nomination form for Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele. Director of Communication of the group, Benigha Ejimba, at a press briefing, in Abuja, said the target of the group was to raise N100 million for the purchase of the nomination form. He explained that their push for the CBN governor to join the 2023 presidential contest is based on their belief in his ability to lead the country effectively. “ESG is peopled by thousands of citizens who have benefited in one way or the other from the numerous economic emancipation initiatives of the Central Bank of Nigeria under the leadership of Mr Godwin Emefiele.  These are citizens who never knew the governor or any person in the hierarchy of the apex bank but qualified and benefitted from these initiatives because they are citizens, and they applied through a transparent public process. .. “As at today, we have received donations from our members of young professionals and other concerned groups  to the tune of N67 million. We are hopeful that by next week, we will have succeeded in raising the sum of N100 million. This will enable us to purchase the the APC Expression of Interest and presidential nomination form, which we already project this sum will be sufficient.” He called on President Muhammadu  Buhari, APC and party delegates to rally round Emefiele, as he is “one man capable of continuing, consolidating, expanding the progressive legacies of our President and also leading our party to victory in the next elections”.
