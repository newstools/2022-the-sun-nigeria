Smugglers who thought they could take advantage of the recent changes to carry out their unlawful trade were disappointed,’ he stated. ‘It is pertinent for me to advise importers, licensed customs agents and freight forwarders to imbibe and always operate on good business etiquette by making sincere declarations all the time. With us on the ground, there will be no hiding place for those wishing to cut corners. They should always acquaint themselves and be guided by policies of the Federal Government and be abreast with the import and export prohibition lists. We will not take ignorance as an excuse under any guise.’ He said the Unit is working 24 hours from day one and smugglers have men and officers of the Unit to contend with any time they dare to carry out their illicit activities either at night or in the day. ‘| am happy to declare that our operatives are relentless and uncompromising as far as this task is concerned. This is just the beginning of heated anti-smuggling action which we have embarked upon in the entire South West area of the country. ‘We are ready to run smugglers out of town with the full support and encouragement of our CGC, Col Hameed Ibrahim Ali, Rtd. This task is aimed at protecting our national economy and preventing dangerous importation as well as exportation that contradicts the law. ‘Our patrolling and interdiction capacity is recharged for round the clock operation against smugglers and anyone attempting to circumvent the due process of import and export,’ he added.
