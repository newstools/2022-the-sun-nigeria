From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure A 40-year-old farmer identified as Idowu Bayode  was, yesterday, macheted by unknown people suspected to be herdsmen in Ikakumo-Akoko in Akoko North East Local Government Area of Ondo State. It was alleged that Bayode was macheted by two herdsmen while working on his farm in the outskirts of the town. Narrating his ordeal, the victim said he went to his cashew plantation, where he met two people already plucking the cashew into sacks and, suddenly, they attacked him with their cutlases while he cried for help. Bayode said his brother later came and saw him in his pool of blood as the herdsmen inflicted deep cuts on him. The Chairman of Ikakumo Development Council, Mr Festus Omogboye, said there was a siege on Ikakumo as people were now afraid to go to their  farms and markets. A community leader, Prince Foluso Aminu, condemned the incident and called on the government to beef up security in the area, being a border town with Edo State. The Divisional Police Officer in charge of Ikare-Akoko, Mr Olatujoye Akinwande, who confirmed the incident, said one person has been arrested in connection with the incident.
