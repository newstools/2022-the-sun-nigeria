Our people have vowed that nobody will penetrate them; that they are intact for you. “Your Excellency, we are here to thank you for all your support, love and the face-lift you have given to this local government, Uzo Uwani. Since you assumed office in 2015, Uzo Uwani has changed for good.  “You started by making sure that you restored peace and security, safeguarding the lives of the people of Uzo Uwani, among other interventions. We cannot take that for granted”. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Matthew Idu, who corroborated the council chairman, described Gov. Ugwuanyi as a peace maker and great achiever, stressing that their loyalty and support for the governor are overwhelming.

Chief Ukuta stated that Ugwuanyi has “been acknowledged worldwide as a man of peace”, adding that “this is enormous and important to us.” “Governor Ugwuanyi is not called a man of peace for nothing. He has a very active conscience, he does not believe in injustice. Your Excellency, we are solidly behind you. All the aces are in your favour. You must not be shaken. Thanks to God you are a man of political sagacity. Nobody can beat you to it. Give the decision and that decision will be implemented.”
