The 1 Division of the Nigerian Army, Kaduna, on Friday, solicited the support of the media to the efforts of the military to secure the country. Spokesman of the Division, Col. Kingsley Umoh, made the appeal when he paid a courtesy visit to the Kaduna NAN office. Umoh said the media must make it a priority to support the unity and integrity of Nigeria, and help to engineer patriotism and responsiveness among Nigerians. Umoh, a Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, maintained that although the military has the capacity to enforce peace, that would only be achieved through conscious engagement of the people to be patriotic to the country. He said the media needed to be more proactive in highlighting key issues that bind Nigerians as a people. “So the media has a role to play in what will unite us as Nigerians, the media have what it takes to promote the image of Nigeria in the right place.” Umoh assured that the Army was ever ready to engage the media positively in carrying out its national assignment. “Nigerian Army is committed to work with media practitioners in what will promote the image of the county in every aspects of life,” he said, and solicited the support of NAN in the various activities of the Division. Responding, NAN Zonal Manager in Kaduna, Mr Maharazu Ahmed assured that the agency would continue to work closely with the Army formation in its efforts to ensure the security of Nigerians. Ahmed said the Agency’s mandate was largely to focus on issues that unite the country, promote integration, mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and development .“We are committed to working with the Nigerian Army in promoting what will unite the country and secure its territory,” he added.(NAN)
