From John Adams, Minna There is atmosphere of uncertainty amongst political office holders and public servants at both state and local government in Niger State over the  March 31 deadline given by the state governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello to those interested to contest any elective office in 2023 to resign their appointment. The office of the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) through the Information Officer, Mallam Lawal Tanko had on Monday evening in a statement, directed all political appointees and other public servants at both state and local government, aspiring for political office in 2023 to tender their resignation letter before March 31, 2022. The statement explained that the decision was informed by the recent Electoral Act 2022, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari which provides that political appointees and public servants aspiring to contest elections must resign their positions before the conduct of political party primaries. The state government’s directive is coming barely one week after the ruling  All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state issued a similar directive through the party secretary, advising these categories of people to quit their office before March 31. Meanwhile, with barely 24 after the state government directives, Mallam Abdulmalik Sarkin Daji, who was temporarily redeployed from ministry for local government, community development and chieftaincy affairs to ministry for youths and sports development has tendered his resignation letter to the government in compliance with directive of government and the new electoral act because of his political ambition for 2023. Daily Sun had three week ago exclusively reported that 15 commissioners and other top aides of the governor are eyeing various political offices in 2023 and would soon tender their resignation letters before the December 31.
