The statement reads: ‘CP Echeng gave this advice Monday, 21st March 2022, following the arrest and interrogation of two suspects: One Peter, ‘M’, 61 years of Mbano, Imo State, and one Elochukwu, ‘M’, 27 years of Ekwusigo LGA, Anambra State for their alleged involvement in a case of defilement of four minors. ‘Investigation reveals that the mother of the victims, a trader, always leaves the children under the care of the suspects whenever she is away at work.
