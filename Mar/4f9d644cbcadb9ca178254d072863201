From Fred Itua, Abuja The Arewa Consultative Youth Movement (ACYM) has lauded the judgement of the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia, which on Friday, nullified Section 84 (12) of the newly amended Electoral Act. In a statement made available to the media in Abuja on Saturday, the ACYM said the sound judgment which affirmed that the controversial section was a violation of the provisions of the nation’s constitution deserved to be celebrated. The group said with the judgment, the coast is now clear for public office holders who were discriminated against by the section to exercise their right to participate fully in their political parties’ conventions and primaries as enshrined in the constitution. The statement read: ‘We, Arewa youths, from the Northern part of this country celebrate this landmark judgment which we believe will further deepen the nation’s democracy. ‘We are of the view that the judgment is a victory for rule of law because it will further widen the democratic space for all interested Nigerians to participate, irrespective of the offices they currently occupy. ‘We celebrate the judgment and we also salute the courage of Justice Evelyn Anyadike who delivered the sound judgment.’
