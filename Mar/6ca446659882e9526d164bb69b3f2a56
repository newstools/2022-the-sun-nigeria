IMF’s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said the Russian invasion of Ukraine would lead to a “deep recession this year.” “Financing needs are large, urgent and could rise significantly as the war continues,” she said, praising the Ukrainian authorities’ emergency policy response. Georgieva said the financial support should help fill the financing gap and mitigate the economic impacts of the war. “Once the war is over and a proper damage assessment can be performed, additional large support is likely to be needed to support reconstruction efforts,” she added.
