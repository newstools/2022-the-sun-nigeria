The Lagos State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission Law 2021 is a testimony to the State Government’s effort towards entrenching accountability in governance and checking malfeasance among officers entrusted with public resources. It is all part of the T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda – the six-pillar development plan of the Sanwo-Olu administration. The Commission will be independent in its operations and functions while complementing the efforts of similar Agencies in the police and federal establishment. The Anti-Corruption Commission Law is intended to deepen accountability and transparency in the expenditure of appropriated public funds. It is backed by the instrument of law to investigate and prosecute officials of the State Government and registered contractors indicted for economic crimes and financial misappropriation.
