Super Eagles have assured that Samuel Chukwueze and Innocent Bonke suffered knocks but not serious enough to keep them away from Tuesday’s return leg World Cup playoffs in Ghana. Super Eagles spokesman Babafemi Raji disclosed that both players are still being assessed. Bonke was forced out in the 64th minute from what appeared to be a groin injury.
