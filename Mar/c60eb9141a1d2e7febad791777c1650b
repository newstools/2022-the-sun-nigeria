A sport consulting firm, Twin Huts Concept, says it has concluded plans to organise a marathon in Borno State tagged “Marathon for Peace 2017’’. Chairman of the firm, Tunde Giwa-Daramola, on Thursday, in Lagos, said that the race had been tentatively slated to hold on April 27 in Maiduguri. Giwa-Daramola said that the event would be powered by the Nigerian Army in their quests to assist in rebuilding the North East region. “Over the years, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai has promoted watersports, basketball and boxing among others. He is currently supporting the Nigerian Army to regain its rightful position in sports. “It will be another opportunity to show the world that normalcy has returned to the North East as the focus is now on rebuilding and attracting investors to the area. “It will also go a long way to promote peace, harmony and brotherhood in the zone. “The inspiration for the Marathon for Peace race is the handwork of Lt.-Gen. TY Buratai, who was a 400 metres runner and a man with a large appetite for sports development,’’ he said. Giwa-Daramola who was the former Commodore of the Nigerian Navy Sailing Club, added that the event would also feature a concert. He urged Nigerians to join hands in making the charity event a success, saying that the proceeds would be channeled to the welfare, reconstruction and rehabilitation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP). The chairman added that prize money and awards would go to winners in the men, women, boys and girls, IDPs, Handicapped and Veterans categories. (NAN)
