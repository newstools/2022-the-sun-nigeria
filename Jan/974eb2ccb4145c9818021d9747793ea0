Riyad Mahrez saved Algeria’s blushes with a double against Zimbabwe in their Africa Cup of Nations opener. The Leicester winger opened the scoring just 12 minutes into the tie after cutting inside on his left foot and curling a succulent effort into the far corner. But Algeria were left stunned by a spectacular first-half display from Zimbabwe, who fought back to lead the game by the break. Kudakwashe Mahachi and Nyasha Mushekwi found the net for the underdogs. However it was Mahrez, by far Algeria’s most influential player, who ensured that Algeria’s campaign did not get off to the worst possible start with a powerful effort from 20 yards to level the game inside the final 10 minutes. Meanwhile, Egypt coach Hector Cuper has banned his players from talking to the media ahead of their 2017 Africa Cup of Nations clash against Mali on Tuesday. According to KingFut, Cuper asked Egyptian Football Association board member Hazem El-Hawary to keep the media away from players at the team’s residence. The Pharaohs manager said that the technical team and players would be allowed to speak to the media during the press conference prior to every game. Daily News Egypt reports that that the Egyptian media contingent was left angered by the coach’s actions. Cuper had also refused to allow the media mission to travel on board the private aeroplane carrying the national team to Gabon, before Hany Abo Rida, president of the EFA, was able to change his mind.
