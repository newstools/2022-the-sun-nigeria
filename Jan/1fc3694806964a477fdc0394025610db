Emmanuel Amuneke has admitted the Super Eagles defense must be at their best when they come face-to-face with Egypt star, Mohamed Salah, in their opening AFCON Group D clash next Tuesday. Salah, 29, is the leading scorer in the Premier League with 16 goals for Liverpool thus far. He has maintained the form he displayed last season. “It’s a big challenge playing against Egypt and a player like Mohamed Salah in the first game,” said Amuneke, who is on the CAF technical study group for the AFCON in Cameroon. “It’s also a big challenge for our defense. We have to defend collectively against him, of course. “We’ve been growing together for a few years now and I believe our defense will be efficient against such a fantastic player.”
