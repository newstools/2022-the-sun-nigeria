The lawmaker noted that with the unity of purpose which the Eagles executed the match showed, much would be achieved in the country if Nigerians are united against the “bloodthirsty evils” threatening to bring the country down. “My only takeaway from today’s (Tuesday) game is that we can achieve much in the country when we remain united in our common purpose. “You can see the character and resilience the players showed against the Egyptians, this is what Nigerians are known for and not the unwarranted killings and abduction that is threatening to tear the nation apart “They started well and I want to urge them to continue with this winning mentality until they come home with the trophy. “Again, I also want the players to know that football is the only thing that makes us see ourselves as one.
