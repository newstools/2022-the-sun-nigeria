From Femi Folaranmi Yenagoa A New Year eve boat mishap has thrown Ogbinbiri community in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa state into mourning following the death of a 39-year- old pastor and six others. According to eyewitnesses, the accident occurred when two boats collided Friday afternoon, causing them to capsize. The deceased pastor identified as Pastor Salvation Degemy, was the General Overseer of the Supernatural Church of God located in the community. The other victims included a husband, his sick wife, two children and other relatives travelling to Yenagoa from the community. Sources said the one of the boats in which the family and the pastor were travelling was conveying a sick woman to Yenagoa for emergency treatment when the accident occurred. The sick lady, sources said, was initially admitted at the Cottage Hospital in the community but the decision was made to move her to Yenagoa after the Cottage Hospital ran out of oxygen. Said the source: “It was recommended that she be taken to Federal Medical Centre in Yenagoa for oxygen. That was where they were heading before the accident happened. “Pastor Salvation Degemy was travelling with them  to engage in prayer for the dying patient,” the source said. Community sources said the tragic event has disrupted the New Year celebration in the community as many people are mourning.
