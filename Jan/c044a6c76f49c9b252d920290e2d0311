Nigeria international, Victor Osimhen, is now expected to return to Naples in the coming hours. Through their Instagram account, Italian Serie A club, Napoli, confirmed on Sunday that Osimhen has tested negative for COVID-19, ten days after news that he tested positive. “Victor is negative to COVID-19 and will return to Italy in the coming hours,” Napoli stated. Osimhen was forced to withdraw from the Nigeria roster for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations due to a combination of health issues and non-release by his European club, and was replaced in the squad list by Henry Onyekuru. The 23-year-old is expected to undergo tests with Professor Tartaro upon his return to Napoli.
