Super Eagles interim boss, Austin Eguavoen, has named Peter Olayinka of Slavia Prague as the player to fill in for Napoli’s Victor Osimhen in the No 9 position; Eguavoen said Olayinka would have to fill the absence of Osimhen in Cameroon. Napoli refused to release Osimhen with the player recovering from a damaging face injury and COVID-19 and Olayinka was called up late to replace him. Other available hands for the No 9 position include Kelechi Iheanacho of Leicester City and Taiwo Awoniyi of Union Berlin or the coach could settle for a false nine with Chidera Ejuke in the absence of Odion Ighalo. “Hopefully Odion comes, if he doesn’t come it’s a bit of a worry. Osimhen is out, it’s also a bit of a worry,” Eguavoen stated in a press conference. “We have Awoniyi, we have Olayinka, we might be forced to play false nine, we have Iheanacho, we have Chidera who can also come from behind and fill the role so might just have to adjust the system of play. “I might play with a striker, I might not play with a striker it depends. Osimhen is out, Olayinka is the next person to fill in.”
