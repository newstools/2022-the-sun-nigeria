The airline’s Communications Manager, Kingsley Ezenwa, said that the donations are in line with the airline’s CSR initiative and philosophy of supporting communities and non-governmental organisations that share similar objectives. Some of the items donated to the Lagos Old People’s Home, Favid Orphanage Home and V.O.W (Hope) Orphanage included bags of rice, spaghetti, clothes, noodles, toiletries, detergents and beverages. The Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Dana Air, Sukhjinder Mann, who led the airline’s team on the visit, said:  “The elderly ones in our midst are our parents and we owe them a duty to take good care of them and see to their happiness at all times. I wish everybody here today good health and happiness. ”At Dana Air we care about the health and well-being of our customers, with additional care and attention for our senior citizens. We will make this a regular initiative and will continue to support them in our own way as a customer and community focussed airline in Nigeria.” On the donation to the orphanage homes, Sukh said it has always been the airline’s tradition to support orphanages , NGOs and the needy in the society. ”Our CSR initiative cuts across all communities and sectors, having pioneered sponsorships in sports, breast and prostate cancer awareness, entertainment, and youth empowerment, I think it won’t be out of place to call on the well-meaning citizens of Nigeria to continue to support these worthy causes,” he said. Dana Air is one of Nigeria’s leading airlines with a mixed fleet of nine aircraft and daily flights from Lagos to Abuja, Port Harcourt, Enugu, and Owerri.
