From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed that those behind the reported massacre of villagers in Zamfara State will be history soon. According to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari expressed outrage at the latest reports of several villagers being massacred by escaping bandits in Zamfara State. Reacting to reports of the large-scale killings, the president said: “The latest attacks on innocent people by the bandits is an act of desperation by mass murderers, now under relentless pressure from our military forces who are well equipped to effectively confront these enemies of humanity. “In keeping with my commitment to tackle the monster of terrorism head on, let me reassure these besieged communities and other Nigerians that this government will not abandon them to their fate because we are more than ever determined to get rid of these outlaws. “These criminals will be history because we are not going to relent in our current military operations to get rid of these thugs who have been terrorising innocent people.” President Buhari appealed to the affected communities for patience, saying: “We are fiercely determined to smoke out and destroy these outlaws who have no regard for the sanctity of life.” While extending his sympathy to the survivors and families of those killed, President Buhari said that “the army and the Air Force are working together to get rid of these callous criminals as they acquire more equipment to track down and eliminate criminal gangs that are subjecting innocent people to the reign of terror, including illegal imposition of taxes on the communities under siege.”
