From Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has berated the leaders and people of Ogoni ethnic nationality for promoting disunity among themselves while blaming the backwardness of their area on others. Governor Wike made the accusation during the 30th celebration of Ogoni Day with the theme: “Leaving no one behind,” at the Birabi Memorial Grammar School, Bori town, in Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State, yesterday. Specifically, Governor Wike queried how many Ogoni leaders can truly defend the interest of Ogoni land, and genuinely pursue issues of environmental degradation and resource control with the same zest demonstrated by their forebears like the late Ken Saro-Wiwa, without selling out. “People like Saro-Wiwa and all of the people you’re celebrating on Ogoni Day, how many of you can today stand for what Ken (Saro-Wiwa) stood for; how many can today stand for the great Ogoni men who died for your struggle?” He noted with regret how some Ogoni people have now debased the struggle and have rather used it to collect money from those who do not want the goals of the struggle achieved. According to the governor, such monetary largesse they make can best be described as  blood money and wondered with what conscience they gather each year to celebrate a struggle that they have betrayed. “You use Ogoni Day to make money. God will never forgive you. I will never be a party to make blood money. All of you, you’re here today for Ogoni Day, are you standing firm for Ogoni people? Are you standing firm for the spirit of those who died for you? Go and check your conscience. Ogoni people check your conscience.” The governor asserted he had never betrayed Rivers’ interest but defended it with courage, including pursuing the OML 11 law suit at the Supreme Court. He observed that the case may not be concluded before his tenure will end, but it may secure the most needed ownership right of such resources to the people. “You people are talking about OML 11. Today, I’m in Supreme Court to challenge the Federal Government and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. I will not be governor forever, I’m leaving next year, but God in heaven will bear me witness, I have protected, defended the interest of the state and interest of Ogoni land.” Governor Wike admonished Ogoni leaders and the people to stop being used as agents of discord by the Federal Government and its agencies to pull down their own and betray the Ogoni interest. He pointed to how Ogonis were contributing to frustrate the political career of one of their bright brains, Magnus Abe, and Ledum Mitee’s long fight to become a Senior advocate of Nigeria. The governor also noted that the same lack of unity seen in Ogoniland is prevalent in the entire Niger Delta because governors in the region, lawmakers and other levels of leaders are hardly working together in unison. According to him, the people of Niger Delta are the ones marginalising themselves because each tribe thinks itself as more Niger Deltan than the other Chairman on the occasion and President, Ijaw National Congress, Benjamin Okaba, said the fundamental problem of the country is the refusal of the Nigerian State to restore the derivation principle that was abrogated by Decree NO.34 of May 1966 by Aguiyi Ironsi, the subsequent promulgation of Petroleum Decree 1966, and General Olusegun Obasanjo’s 1978 Land Use Act considered widely as the most obnoxious, draconian and unjust piece of legislation on land and resource ownership.
