Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Men of the 32 Artillery Brigade of the Nigerian Army, in Ondo State, on Wednesday, seized 63 bags of cannabis sativa otherwise known as marijuana, in Owo, headquarters of Owo Local Government Area of the state. The soldiers, who acted on a tip-off, were said to have raided some farms in the town before they discovered the weeds loaded in bags. Public Relations Officer of the artillery, Major Ojo Adelegan, told Daily Sun that 23 expended cartridges and nine unexpended catridges were also recovered during the raid. Adelegan said the operation was at the instance of some residents of the town who volunteered information to the soldiers on the activities of some miscreants in the area. He said a gang of notorious miscreants was discovered in a hideout in the forest after which the illicit drugs and items were also discovered. According to him, “During the operation there was exchange of fire between our own troop and the criminals who later fled as a result of the power of our men against them.” The army spokesman added that no arrest was made, stressing that efforts are on to ensure that the miscreants and others dealing with illicit drugs in the state are arrested. He also urged the people to avail the security agencies useful information on any criminal act in the state, just as he warned criminals to stay away from the state, stressing that there is no room for any illegality and criminally-minded persons in the state.
